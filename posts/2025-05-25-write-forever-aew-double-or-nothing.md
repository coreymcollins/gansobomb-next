It's Double or Nothing night! I'm not going to say that this is a two-match show for me, but I am exceedingly excited for two matches more than the rest: Jamie Hayter vs Mercedes Moné and Hangman Page vs Will Ospreay. I'm stoked for a lot of the rest of the show as well (Paragon excluded), but those two matches are the main draw for me tonight.

I think both outcomes are basically set in stone without any big surprises, but who knows what could happen! My guess is we're set for Mercedes/Toni and Ospreay/Mox at All In, but I'd be happy with either outcome which I'm not sure is a feeling I've felt about every other Owen Hart Cup tournament final thus far.

We also have Anarchy in the Arena and my hope upon hopes is that, with the inclusion of Gabe Kidd in this whole mess as of late, we get the return of Eddie Kingston. Please, Eddie – backfist every Death Rider into orbit.

## Mercedes Moné, the best to ever do it

In the opening match, we answered the question of who will be facing the Women's World Champion at All In with Mercedes Moné vs Jamie Hayter. What a way to kick off the show!

There was absolutely no question in mind that this would be a show-stealer and it was absolutely that. A perfect way to start the PPV proper with the crowd hot the entire way.

They built to a lot of false finishes that I bit on in favor of Jamie Hayter, which I always appreciate when the outcome of a match is essentially certain. That's the fun of being an adult wrestling fan: knowing how the story will likely end but believing the story being told enough to have a moment of disbelief.

Mercedes walked away with the win in an excellent match, adding yet another Match of the Night candidate to her already lengthy list. The ending was a bit frightening with a DDT/small package (was it supposed to be a DDT?) spiking Hayter head-first into the mat. Hopefully she's a-okay and has something ahead for her leading into All In.

That would be the only negative coming out of this: the chance that Hayter gets lost in the shuffle of the main women's feuds going on. Things get even more tied-up with Mercedes, the TBS Champion, challenging for the World Title at All In. With both women's titles potentially tied up in one match, I hope we still get another one or two other women's matches on the show.

Let there be no question about it: Mercedes Moné is one of the, if not the, best that has ever done it. From character work to promos to in-ring work, she may have many peers but few have done it as good or better. Of course, she's walking into All In against the one other woman in this business who may do it all even better which means the Women's World Title match at All In is as likely to be a show-stealer as this match was.

## Of blood and scissors

As expected, Mark Briscoe and Ricochet had a bloody, brutal first-ever-in-AEW Stretcher Match. I love a good old-school, goofball gimmick match every now and then especially with wrestlers who can stay true to the heart of the gimmick while upping the quality to meet today's standards.

This wasn't your standard "put the guy on the stretcher, wheel it for a while, the guy escapes, repeat" stretcher match. The stretchers were used mostly as weapons rather than match-winning devices which worked out much better.

Briscoe bled a gusher, looking like an absolute maniac with his face painted red, half of his teeth missing, and brandishing a pair of golden scissors.

Ricochet got the unsurprising win after revealing a _second_ pair of scissors and stabbing Briscoe a few times before depositing him in the ambulance. Y'know, classic wrestling stuff! Ricochet gets a needed win and can move onto, hopefully, a title picture or at least stepping stones _to_ a title picture. The same could be said for Briscoe, though – both guys deliver big time each time out and it'd be heartwarming to see their hard work pay off.

## I guess sometimes friends kiss

Toni Storm finished answering the question of what the Women's World Title Match would be at All In by defeating Mina Shirakawa to retain her title. This wasn't my _favorite_ recent match of either Toni or Mina, but it was still a good match. The crowd didn't seem quite as rabid for this as they were for Mercedes/Hayter earlier in the night, but that could be PPV fatigue having set in.

I was a bit surprised to not have the return of Mariah May or the debut of Thekla in the post-match. Thekla teases have been happening during women's matches for a weeks now, but maybe she has a different target? And while there have been rumors that Mariah could be WWE-bound (awful news), there's still a contingent that thinks she may just be playing both sides for more money (great news).

Thinking more deeply about it, it wouldn't have made a ton of sense for anyone to show up after the match since Toni's future is figured out through July. So, unless someone was just going to target Mina then ending without shenanigans was just fine.

In the post-match we did get, though, Toni and Mina did bury the hatchet and smooch a little bit to the delight of the crowd and bemusement of Taz on commentary. Toni stays winning by beating her opponents' asses and then making out with them.

## Let some of those bodies hit the floor

Anarchy in the Arena was exactly what it needed to be: a bunch of goofball bullshit from before the opening bell even rang. We got three songs playing throughout the match this time around: The Young Bucks' flute and drum intro, "I'm So Excited" by The Pointer Sisters, and "Bodies" by Drowning Pool. This will be the first and last time those three songs are ever grouped together in history.

The babyfaces prevailed by locking Death Riders in the back of the ambulance still in the building after the Stretcher Match earlier in the night when Kenny Omega hit Matt Jackson with a One Winged Angel through an exploding table off the ramp while Swerve Strickland stomped Nick Jackson with thumbtack sneakers.

I wasn't expecting a babyface win here, honestly. I figured we'd get more Death Riders standing tall for Mox leading into All In, but the way it was done sours the relationship between Death Riders and The Young Bucks. This opens up stories for Death Riders and The Elite to have a quick falling out that could have interesting implications for All In.

What happens if, later tonight, Hangman becomes number one contender (unlikely) with The Bucks now (possibly) sworn enemies of Death Riders? I don't see a babyface turn for The Bucks already, but they could be a nasty wrench in the gears of Death Riders if everything pans out correctly.

Lots of little bits of intrigue will come out of this match!

My only gripe is that I wish there was more for Willow and Marina to do. We know Willow can go full sicko mode and it would have been great to see her bloody more people/get bloody and do some wacko shit.

## Leaves IS plants, dumbass

I predicted from the very beginning that Will Ospreay would win The Owen and go on to dethrone Jon Moxley to save us all from Death Riders at All In. It just made sense. He had been on such an upswing and seemed poised to be the new poster boy for AEW.

But then a funny thing happened. _"Hangman" Adam Page_ happened. It's not like we didn't know the story of Hangman or that he is, undoubtedly, one of the _actual_ pillars of AEW. It just felt like he had his own thing going on and his fears, doubts, insecurities, and obsessions would be he undoing.

Along the way, though, Hanger started to grow. He began to move past his death wish for Swerve Strickland and started to see that the things he had put Swerve through hadn't made him a better or more honest person, but a worse person who needed to atone for his actions.

While Hangman and Swerve still aren't the best of friends, they appear to have a mutual respect and understanding that they didn't have six months ago. With all of that in the rear view, things began to shift a bit. Although I had picked Ospreay to win the tournament, seeds of doubt began to plant themselves in my brain.

From those seeds grew full-blown theories of how Hangman could be the one shining star of AEW to bring the World Title back home.

Tonight, both guys got special entrances and were both made to feel like huge deals. It didn't feel imbalanced at all, which made the unpredictability rates raise even higher.

And then it happened.

"Hangman" Adam Page defeated Will Ospreay to win the 2025 Owen Hart Cup and guarantee himself a shot at the World Title at All In.

I'd never been happier to be wrong about a wrestling prediction.

While both guys beat the hell out of each other and showed some frustration toward one another, they ended the night with a handshake and a hope – the hope that the loser would still have the winner's back against Mox and Death Riders at All In.

Will Ospreay remain a man of his word? Or will the disappointment of not being able to walk into Forbidden Door in London as World Champion grow a darkness in his heart? Only time will tell.

## Wrapping Up

Nigel McGuinness and Daniel Garcia vs FTR was a fun match hurt a bit by pacing. Once we got to the Tony Schiavone & Nigel telenovela portion of the match, everything slowed down a bit too awkwardly and affected the quality of the rest of the match, in my opinion. Not that the storyline stuff was bad at all! I've loved this entire story, but stuff like this always mucks up a match. Still good stuff from everybody, though.

The Tag Team Title match between The Hurt People and The Sons of Texas was fine, but also suffered from the same thing the other tag match on the show suffered from: too much buffoonery during the match that cut off the flow of the match. When it was just a tag team match it was enjoyable enough but I'm still not gaga over Lashley and Shelton as champions. Here's hoping they can have a feud with an actual tag team now that this MJF shit is over (for now).

Kazuchika Okada and "Speedball" Mike Bailey had an excellent match that, once again, had me biting on finishes from Bailey despite me "knowing" going into things that Okada wouldn't be dropping the belt. Bailey is over big in this household as a non-binary, French-Canadian, Grillo's eating, Balatro gear wearer. I'm still holding out hope that we get a unification match between Okada and Omega at All In.

lol Paragon.
