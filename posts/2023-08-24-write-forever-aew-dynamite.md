You might notice a little someone in the background of the featured image for this series. I made that graphic last week when I settled on the name of a "column" (or whatever) I'll write for current wrestling stuff I'm watching. Based on one of my least favorite wrestling chants of all time, welcome to Write Forever.

When I made the baseline image for this thing, I just threw Terry Funk in there because I love Terry Funk and his iconic "Forever!" retirement speech in Japan will live in my heart and brain forever.

Well, he was going to anyway but now he'll doubly live in the featured image for this series forever too. I'm sure he's overjoyed.

Terry Funk was a real special wrestler for me. He was one of my favorite LJN action figures because he not only came with a hat, but a cattle prod too – extra clothes *and* a weapon! It's kind of crazy that he was around just long enough in that sweet spot of 80s WWF to get a figure before shuffling off to the NWA/WCW for a while.

The Funker really captured my heart in ECW, especially since we had to sing *"Desperado"* in middle school chorus one year. I'd never hear *"Desperado"* again without thinking of Terry Funk.

Terry Funk Forever.

Now, onto Dynamite.

We're blessed to start the show with the greatest entrance in all of AEW – The Gunns and Juice Robinson. I love those dipshit vaporwave cowboys and I love Juice Robinson, the love-child of Jack Black and that Honeycombs monster.

The opener is supposed to be Bullet Club Gold versus The Elite, but it descends into chaos immediately, the match being thrown out after Juice lays referee Rick Knox flat with the Left Hand of God. The two sides brawl back in forth with Jay White, Konosuke Takeshita, and FTR all getting involved before things fizzle out with Takeshita retreating from a valiant Omega.

In the next saga of the MJF/Adam Cole story, Renee Paquette interviews the AEW World Champion about the upcoming main event at Wembley. I'm still not sure what's going to happen between these two. Part of me sees Cole turning heel and forcing a face turn on MJF, but maybe this entire thing is just MJF up to his old tricks.

MJF could easily be the top guy in AEW as a heel or a babyface, and whichever direction we go after Wembley should be entertaining either way. I do think Cole works far better as a smarmy little heel (maybe with some lackeys), so I think I'd prefer that to another listless Adam Cole babyface run.

News has been making the rounds that Rey Fenix is having some sort of visa issues which will preclude him from traveling to London for All In, so tonight we get Mox vs Fenix in what I assume will include a storyline beat to write Fenix off for a couple of weeks.

In a shocking twist, it's Fenix's face exploding in blood and not Moxley's! My world is being turned completely upside down today. Fenix looks strong here, getting a number of super-close near falls on Mox late in the match. If his travel issues are going to keep him out of the Stadium Stampede this weekend, they're at least giving him a nice chance to shine on his own.

Mox drops Fenix with an avalanche Death Rider, a move I'm not sure I remember seeing since Mox used it on Darby Allin years back – but Fenix only stays down for two! Frustrated, Mox locks in the rear naked choke and in a matter of moments puts Fenix to sleep for the win. Fenix yet again looks strong, refusing to tap out in favor of passing out.

Post-match, the Blackpool Combat Club hit the ring with crowbars and are ready to wreak havoc on Fenix but Eddie Kingston and Penta begin making their way to the ring. Until... a wild Ortiz appears to stop the pair?

There's a brief standoff before *SANTANA'S* music begins playing and he makes his long-awaited return, laying waste to Kingston and Penta on the ramp!

PROUD AND MOTHER FUCKING POWERFUL ARE BACK

Oh, and in the mix of all of this Fenix got hit in the face with a crowbar which will write him out of All In.

But fuck it. Santana & Ortiz have apparently reconciled whatever differences they had and will, it appears, be the mystery partners of the BCC in Wembley.

Back from a break, Fenix is loaded into an ambulance on a stretcher and is joined by his skeleton brother as we catch a glimpse of an EMT's butt crack. I wonder if that's a sentence that's ever been written anywhere else before?

Backstage, 2point0 and Daniel Garcia confront Sammy Guevara for saving Chris Jericho from the Don Callis Family beatdown last week. They suggest that Sammy is always there for Jericho but question if Jericho will be there for Sammy. Daniel Garcia *does not* dance, so the night is ruined.

In a story-heavy episode, we head to the ring for the official contract signing of Jericho vs Will Ospreay at Wembley. There's nothing out of the ordinary here – Ospreay and Jericho both deliver some nice, impassioned promos before things devolve into violence with Jericho knocking Ospreay to the mat. Security breaks things up with the contract officially signed.

Backstage, Renee is now interviewing Adam Cole about the match at Wembley. As she did with MJF, Renee throws to a video package of some of the turmoil that has befallen Cole and MJF over the past few weeks. Cole's reaction is different than that of MJF earlier in the night – he's enraged and calls off the rest of the interview, furious that nobody can accept the fact that two people can just be friends the way he and MJF are. He insists into the camera that there are no problems between he and Max before storming off set. Projecting a little, maybe?

Up next, we get a preview of All In with Darby Allin & Nick Wayne taking on Swerve Strickland and AR Fox. It's a Tornado Tag Match ahead of the tag team Coffin Match with Darby and Sting facing Swerve and Fox in London. Things start off fast, which is no surprise, before devolving into a good old fashioned walk and brawl for a bit.

As things get back toward the ring, Wayne's nose is obliterated and blood runs down his face as Darby Allin is wiped out on the arena floor. Fox and Swerve grab a number of near falls on Wayne, the youngster surviving several huge shots from the Mogul Embassy. In the end, Wayne picks up a quick pin on Fox while Darby holds Swerve to keep him from making the save – Swerve and Fox eat the loss before Wembley!

Post-match, Swerve begins laying into Fox for losing the match and my heart is absolutely breaking. I love the pairing of Swerve and Fox, and really just the fact that *anything* is happening with AR Fox in general. Swerve tells Fox that if he can't trust him to beat an 18-year-old child, how can he trust him to win in front of 80,000 people in Wembley?

Swerve hands the mic off to Prince Nana who officially fires Fox from the group before Brian Cage vaporizes into existence and lays Fox out with a massive lariat. Darby, Sting, and Wayne come back down to the ring to make the save and Darbs extends his hand to Fox to make amends.

Darby grabs the mic and asks Swerve who he's going to have at Wembley now that he's kicked Fox to the curb – and out come Christian Cage and Luchasaurus. Christian fulfills his prophecy of feuding with wrestlers with dead dads and calls out Nick Wayne directly with some beautiful horrible lines about Nick's late father Buddy Wayne.

Christian tells Wayne that he should stay away from Wembley so that he doesn't have to see another person he loves have a coffin closed on him. I don't know how we got here, but Christian's natural enemy being people without living fathers is one of the best weirdo twists in recent AEW memory.

A fun few minutes of story here, though I really hate that Fox is out of Mogul Embassy and I hope it's some long con because him with Swerve is just so fucking good. I'm mostly worried about Fox getting lost in the shuffle again as a directionless babyface because it felt like he had real momentum as a character with this heel turn.

Backstage, we get another face-to-face-to-face-to-face with The Young Bucks and FTR interviewed by Renee. The two argue about legacy and muh famuhly, hitting all of the beats you'd expect. They don't honestly need to say much because the match will speak for itself and should be one of several potential matches of the night.

Ruby Soho and Skye Blue have the pre-main event slot and it's just fine, but it doesn't really mean much of anything. Neither woman is involved in the 4-way Women's Title match at Wembley, so this just feels like filler to have *some* women's division thing on the show. And since we all know the rule in AEW is "one women's match per show", I guess we take what we can get.

I'm more annoyed that it looks like we have our big 80,000+ stadium show in London just days away and the best they can do for the women's division is one 4-way match. No announced TBS Title Match as of yet, but maybe we'll get Willow/Mercedes announced at some point.

What's frustrating is that there is enough happening in the women's division to have two or three different women's matches at All In, but they're just phoning it in with a big multi-person match which feels incredibly lazy.

Star of the Show Roderick Strong is backstage with his neckbrace and The Kingdom, making the statement that at the end of All In everybody will know "who the true MJF is and who the true Adam Cole is." Again, I'm split on which direction this goes. Is it all a ruse by MJF who has picked up a trio of underlings in The Kingdom and Strong? Is Cole ready to reunite with his former friends in Taven, Bennett, and Strong? Time will tell!

Back in the arena, The Acclaimed rush to the ring and call out The House of Black to end things once and for all after HOB's actions on Collision where they destroyed the boots of Daddy Ass. The Trios Champions make their way to the ring with Julia Hart by their side and it's academic as three overpower two.

But hark! Daddy Ass comes gently to the ring! Billy backs off the champions and then grabs the mic, officially laying out the challenge for the Trios Titles at All In – but it won't be Daddy Ass in London, it'll be "Bad Ass" Billy Gunn. I can't help but notice how much Billy's hand is shaking holding the microphone and I wonder if it's just nerves or something more serious. Maybe he's just aching for some scissoring.

Now it's main event time, and it's... it's Aussie Open against the fucking Hardys. I can't bring myself to really care about this one, and I have to wonder why they wouldn't make Mox/Fenix the main event. It's a much better main event in terms of guaranteed match quality, plus there are all of the storyline elements. I appreciate what The Hardys have done in their careers, but Jeff is a mess who looks terrible in the ring and Matt is just simply showing his age like you'd expect for a guy his age who has done the things he's done.

The story here, if you can believe there is one, is whether or not Aussie Open can defeat The Hardys to guarantee their spot against MJF and Cole in London. In the shock of the century, Aussie Open retain the ROH Tag Team Titles after killing Jeff Hardy just a little bit.

Post-match we get a quick little promo from Kyle Fletcher which draws out their Wembley challengers, MJF and Cole. The four men face off briefly before coming to blows, MJF and Cole eventually getting the better of their future opponents. MJF and Cole setup for their patented double clothesline but it's avoided by Davis.

With Cole's back turned, MJF saves him from a Fletcher attack. The World Champion pulls Fletcher to his feet and holds him for Cole who attempts a superkick, only for Fletcher to move out of the way. MJF catches Cole's foot and the two stare each other down before MJF makes for the exit. MJF reaches into his pocket and slides the Dynamite Diamond Ring over his pinky, readying a shot on Cole – before placing the ring back in his pocket and hugging it out with his unlikely partner.

A decent little segment to end the show on top of a forgettable main event, but overall a fun Dynamite with a lot of moving parts heading toward Wembley.
