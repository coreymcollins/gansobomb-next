It's the night before AEW Dynasty and tonight's Collision is looking, in my opinion, a bit more stacked than [the last go-home edition of Collision](/posts/2025-03-08-write-forever-aew-collision) before a PPV. The main event looks to be Mercedes Moné and Harley Camerson vs Athena and Julia Hart, all of whom will be competing in the 2025 Owen Hart Cup tournament.

In a preview of tomorrow night's Trios Title match, Cash Wheeler and PAC go head to head. My gut tells me that [Rated FTR](/posts/2025-03-26-write-forever-aew-dynamite) implode at Dynasty, but I'm not sure how it'll all go down. Will we get the somewhat more expected outcome of FTR turning on Adam Copeland, or will Cope beat them to the punch?

Also on the card, Powerhouse Hobbs and Tomohiro Ishii face Kyle Fletcher and Konosuke Takeshita, "Speedball" Mike Bailey wrestles Dralistico and Top Flight wrestle CRU in the next chapter of their forever-saga, plus lots of little talkies to build toward Dynasty on Sunday night.

It's sad times in AEW with the recent injury news of Jay White, Orange Cassidy, _and_ Mark Davis but let's chin up (tits out) and see what unravels on the night before the night where Swerve Strickland saves us all from more Death Riders bullshit.

## Let's go Max, you're the best wrestler alive!

It seems as though things may come to a head for Max Caster tomorrow night at Dynasty.

More often recently, Max has been referencing his former partner, Anthony Bowens, without necessarily saying his name all that much. This is a bit of a contrast from Max in weeks prior, not really talking too much about his former Acclaimed partner.

Tonight, Max fell to Mark Briscoe in another open challenge match but made sure to take a dig at Bowens _and_ tell everybody that the open challenge would be coming to Dynasty in Philadelphia.

This seems like the perfect opportunity to move things forward with Anthony Bowens returning to stomp a hole in Max Caster. I imagine Bowens returns tomorrow night and squashes his former partner, but that we get a bit more of a prolonged feud between the two.

Will Max ride this one out alone? Or will he try to find someone to back him up to try and squeeze out some wins after Sunday? Stokely Hathaway has been missing for a long time and he seems like someone who would be perfect to tag along with Max and help influence some match outcomes.

My main hope is that whatever happens, Bowens returns without Billy Gunn and with maybe some new theme music. It's probably worth using the old music, or at least its opening sting, tomorrow night for the big pop but it's never a good sign when a guy keeps all of the stuff related to a tag team after the tag team splits up.

Caster has at least moved on with new music and a new twist on his character, plus he's dropped the rap-to-the-ring entrance. If Bowens shows up tomorrow night with the same old Billy Gunn and the same old scissoring it'll feel like a step backward.

## Collision's healthy mid-card

A lot happens in the mid-card on Collision. We finally got the Top Flight/CRU match, but not just that – we also got a bit more development out of Nick Wayne. Christian Cage hasn't been seen much at all lately and Nick seems to be starting to venture out on his own.

Post-match, CRU laid another beatdown on Top Flight until AR Fox intervened. Nick Wayne evened the sides to lay out Fox, leading to the announcement of Nick Wayne & CRU vs AR Fox & Top Flight on tomorrow's Zero Hour. It will be interesting to see what becomes of Nick Wayne, Kip Sabian, and The Patriarchy whenever Christian does pop up again. For now, I'm enjoying Wayne getting some time to shine on his own.

Frustration was the name of the game yet again with Rated FTR tonight. Cash Wheeler ate a loss to PAC after, shock of shocks, Death Rider interference. When Wheeler Yuta went to clobber Cash with a bell hammer, Dax Harwood threw himself in front of the bullet and took the blow. In the confusion, PAC was able to eke out a pin on Cash.

Post-match, a disappointed Dax sat in the ring clutching his head but _did_ accept a hand from both Cash and Copeland leading to an embrace between the three. A trio mended or simply the calm before the storm at Dynasty?

We got a quick little STP promo with Shane Taylor and The Infantry calling out The Opps in not so many words. I'd be more excited if I hadn't already seen this play out a dozen times by now. STP seems to pop up with promos and a few weeks of a feud before eating the loss and fading into the background/ROH again. If I could ask for one thing in 2025, it'd be for a serious push on AEW TV for _at least_ Shane Taylor and Lee Moriarty.

## Wrapping Up

Overall, a bit of a letdown of a Collision that ended up feeling the same way the last go-home Collision felt. Not a lot of oomph in many of the matches, but nothing that was outright bad.

Tomorrow's Dynasty has a bit less hype for me than Revolution did except that I'm _incredibly_ locked in for the World Title main event - a complete reverse from Revolution where I was absolutely dreading the World Title main event. Toni Storm vs Megan Bayne is also high on my list, as I'm not sure where they go with either woman after Dynasty regardless of the outcome. I think I'd be happy with either woman winning, but I don't see Storm dropping before All In.

Aside from those two matches, everything else on the show should be good-to-great. I think I've only been let down by an AEW PPV once, and even then it was just a fine show and not shockingly bad or anything – AEW has just given itself a truly insane quality to live up to with PPVs.

Just please, please, _please_ let me get what I want: Swerve Strickland taking the World Title away from Jon Moxley.
