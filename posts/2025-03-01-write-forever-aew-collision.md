I am decidedly _not_ here for an [Adam Cole](/posts/2024-11-20-write-forever-aew-dynamite) TNT Title run, and I hope upon hope that Daniel Garcia retains tonight. Undisputed Kingdom as Trios Champions? Yes. Adam Cole as a singles champion? No thank you.

Tonight's show has some fun stuff lined up, though! While I don't want Cole to win and his singles run has been uninspiring thus far, maybe he'll pull something out against Garcia. FTR should have an excellent tag match against Kyle O'Reilly and Roderick Strong, while Julia Hart and [Queen Aminata](/posts/2024-11-27-write-forever-aew-dynamite) will likely kick each other's faces off.

[Revolution](/posts/2024-03-03-write-forever-aew-revolution) is just about a week away and _that_ card also looks like it's going to be another total killer. Great matches up and down the card with nothing that feels like filler or overwrought bullshit. Thankfully, we've moved from Jeff Jarrett to Hangman Adam Page for MJF which is maybe the biggest upgrade in AEW history. The more we can forget about that awful MJF/Jarrett promo-off the better.

## Something old, something new for FTR

FTR has felt a bit stale for a while now. Their matches are generally great (or at least very good), but they've been floundering in terms of character or story for many months.

First, they aligned with Adam Copeland for a short run that was maybe born out of circumstance as the three men came together after the horrific storms and flooding in Asheville. This included a feud with Death Riders, though the trio only ran a few matches together.

Then, they paired up with The Outrunners which seemed like a pairing tailor-made for an FTR heel turn on the beloved babyface Youngest Men Alive. That partnership basically disappeared, though, without any kind of resolution. They just sort of all stopped appearing together at a certain point.

FTR popped back up as partners to Daniel Garcia on [last week's Dynamite](/posts/2025-02-26-write-forever-aew-dynamite) which led into a tag match tonight with Kyle O'Reilly and Roderick Strong.

The match? Incredible stuff, and it felt like watching the _old_ Collision that was built on not only amazing tag team matches but amazing opening matches running 20+ minutes. That damn feeling was restored, baby!

Now, with this third run at something for FTR to do it seems like we're finally getting some new character development. FTR technically won the match after a Dax piledriver on O'Reilly, but Dax demanded the match be restarted when he noticed KOR's foot was on the ropes – a fact that the referee missed.

The match was restarted and late in the match, the desperate FTR attempted to cheat to win with a handful of tights on a roll-up. This didn't come to fruition, though, and FTR's sportsmanship came back to bite them as Undisputed Kingdom pulled off the win.

Post-match, KOR and Strong asked for a handshake from FTR but were denied. FTR left the ring to a round of boos, and with a newfound sense of interest in where this all goes next.

I liked Dax Harwood's maroon kneepads. 

## Is Adam Cole finally back?

Adam Cole has looked a lot better than he has in a long, long time. He's never been the biggest or most cut guy, but he has looked far more toned than I remember him ever looking the past couple of weeks.

In his match against Garcia, it felt like watching a completely different Adam Cole than the one who returned to AEW a few months back and was having melodramatic, "stares at hands" types of matches with everybody. This Adam Cole is wrestling with more purpose and severity.

Daniel Garcia, to his credit, veered a bit into Little Shit territory playing more of the heel against Cole and absolutely reveling in it. Garcia is great as a babyface or a heel, but it's a real delight when his cocky heel tendencies come out here and there.

There was some fun interplay with the earlier FTR/Undisputed Kingdom match in this one. Garcia utilized the piledriver on Cole but without the technique of Dax, he was only able to pick up a two count. Garcia then used ankle lock on Cole, a move consistently used by Undisputed Kingdom.

After a second piledriver on the apron from Garcia, Cole mustered the strength to get back into the ring and continue the fight until STP rushed the ring to attack both men and spoil what was an otherwise very good match.

I'm never a big fan of finishing a match in a schmoz, especially when it's been a quality match. Garcia and Cole went for 15 minutes in what was easily Cole's best singles match since returning from injury, only to have things tossed out without a clear winner.

While I'm delighted to see STP on my screen more, and while it seems like Cole and Friends may be heading into an extended story with STP and away from singles titles, it's always just such a deflating way to end a match.

## No Hounds allowed in Deeb's Dojo (bitch)

In an excellent match that had minor rough spots (holy fuck that curb stomp on Julia), Queen Aminata picked up a big win over Julia Hart. This was a rematch of their recent match that saw the two beat the piss out of each other, with Julia ending up with a boot print and blood on her face.

With a little picture-in-picture promo, Serena Deeb talked about how she offered the services of Deeb's Dojo to Queen Aminata including a game plan to beat Julia Hart. Aminata utilized that to a T with some trademark Deeb offense targeting the knee of Julia.

After avoiding Julia's picture-perfect moonsault, Aminata wiped Julia out with the sliding kick in the ropes to pick up what is probably her biggest AEW TV victory.

Post-match, Brody King came in to check on Julia but was attacked by Kazuchika Okada. Okada recently beat Buddy Matthews at Grand Slam to retain his Continental Championship and, earlier tonight, had a backstage run-in with Brody and Julia.

Brody had an all-star showing in this year's Continental Classic and I swear on everything good and pure in this world, if Brody King is the man who dethrones Kazuchika Okada I will shit. Give it to me. Give me what I want!

## Wrapping Up

Convalescing in bed after being piledriven on the stage by Mariah May, a neckbrace-clad (NECK STRONG) Toni Storm laid some more groundwork for their World Title rematch at Revolution: it will now be a no-holds-barred, Falls Count Anywhere Match. I would expect Toni and Mariah to pull out all of the stops to up the ante one more time as their story, presumably, comes to a close.

We got perhaps the biggest development in any story in AEW history, something that folks have been chomping at the bit about for months – the in-ring return of Big Boom AJ! In a backstage segment, Johnny TV challenged AJ and two friends to meet him and MXM at Revolution.

Using AJ and Son as pre-show filler is the perfect use for them. People seem to enjoy their shtick and taking up time on the pre-show is much preferred to taking up actual PPV or TV time in the ring. And it'll be nice to see MXM back on an AEW show! Later in the show, it was revealed that AJ's partners would be Orange Cassidy and Mark Briscoe which is a baffling move with Cassidy coming off of an extremely hot match with Takeshita on Dynamite.

While I'm basically over The Learning Tree stuff at this point, you really can't go wrong by putting Bryan Keith and Big Bill in the main event – especially against Powerhouse Hobbs and Bandido. This match whipped ass and was the perfect way to close out yet another excellent episode of AEW TV.

The company has been on a hot streak with their shows for a month or two now; who knows what changed, but it feels like a new spark has been lit under everybody on the roster with almost every segment and match on Dynamite and Collision burning bright.
