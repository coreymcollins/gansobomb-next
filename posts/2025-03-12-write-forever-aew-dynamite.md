We're coming off of an incredible [AEW Revolution](/posts/2025-03-09-write-forever-aew-revolution), one of the most stacked AEW PPVs since the last AEW PPV. Despite a miserable slog of a main event (and a Tag Team Title match which was just fine), the rest of the card was off the charts.

Tonight, we get the fallout from Revolution including hearing from new International Champion [Kenny Omega](/posts/2025-01-05-write-forever-njpw-wrestle-dynasty), Toni Storm, and MJF _plus_ we'll kick off a tournament to see who will challenge Omega for the International Title at Dynasty.

There's one wildcard in the tournament who will be revealed tonight. Some folks are guessing that this will be the debuting "Speedball" Mike Bailey. I'm not on the edge of my seat waiting for Bailey to arrive in AEW. I'm able to see that he's technically very good at what he does, but he's never really captivated me. Something about his offense has always felt a little too theatrical or over-rehearsed or _something_.

I've been proven wrong about a lot of people once they get to AEW, though, so I'll be happy to be wrong about Bailey.

## Kenny Omega's future comes into view

We got the first two matches in the Dynasty International Title Tournament, with Mike Bailey and Orange Cassidy advancing to the next round. The other first round matches happen on Collision: Katsuyori Shibata vs Ricochet and Mark Davis vs Mark Briscoe.

Bailey and Beast Mortos had an excellent match with Bailey looking great in victory and Mortos looking strong in defeat, as Mortos usually does. I didn't find myself having the same problem with Bailey's offense here, and perhaps it's because of the tighter time restraints of television matches as compared to indie matches that typically have much more breathing room for everyone to get their shit in.

Bailey's kicks and dives look crisp and I think he'll be a solid fit on the roster, even though I've felt like we were at capacity on the men's roster for quite some time now. I'd much rather see the women's roster being filled out with more segments and concurrent storylines for the women, but that's a gripe for another time.

Cassidy and Hechicero had a fun match in the main event, though the result was never really in question. Cassidy continues to inject more personality into his character since his return, freshening him up as we move toward Dynasty. Hechicero is always so fun to watch and I wish, out of all of the luchadores who weave in and out of AEW, that he was more of a constant. His offense is incredibly unique, he's shaped like a barrel, and he sometimes has a fireball during his entrance. What more could you want?!

Next week's four-way is halfway there with Cassidy and Bailey advancing to meet either Briscoe/Davis and Shibata/Ricochet. With this field, whoever winds up facing Omega in Philadelphia is going to be a win-win.

## Revolution fallout for the World Champions

Next week we get a rematch of Jon Moxley vs Adam Copeland for the World Title in a Street Fight. I'm not excited to see this match again, but I am excited that it's happening so soon after Revolution so that we can hopefully put a pin in this whole Mox/Copeland thing.

Early in the show we got a clip of Swerve Strickland backstage at Revolution talking about taking his shot at Dynasty. He was interrupted by Copeland who said if Copeland isn't World Champion by the time Swerve wins the belt at Dynasty that he'll be looking for him. Please, _no_. Maybe Swerve could get a good match out of Copeland, but he's eaten up enough time in the main event when there are far more interesting wrestlers who could be in his spot.

Later on, Will Ospreay cut a promo laying out his own goals for the World Title: he wants to challenge whoever is the champion at the time on July 12 at All In in Texas. Ospreay's path to the All In main event is a singular one and that is to win the Owen Hart Cup to become the number one contender. In a backstage promo immediately after Ospreay's, Jay White bristled at the idea of Ospreay becoming the World Champion at All In. Could Jay also be heading toward the Owen Hart Cup?

It's always a blast when multiple people are gunning for the World Title (or any title). It makes the show more dynamic and it makes everything just _make sense_. Why wouldn't everyone be trying to become the number one contender at the same time? Now we've got Copeland, Swerve, Ospreay, and Jay White all aiming for the belt which only makes the belt seem that much more important.

"Timeless" Toni Storm vowed a new beginning after The Hollywood Ending in a promo filled with innuendo and... well, more innuendo. She asked the women of AEW to put their keys into the bowl and get ready for an orgy before being completely laid out by Megan Bayne, who looks to be staking her claim at a World Title shot.

It feels a little early to me to put Bayne into a title program unless she's going to win the belt, and I don't think it's time for that. Bayne has been in a feud, albeit weird and slightly stilted, with Thunder Rosa and Kris Statlander and it didn't seem like that story was done being told – though we may have swapped Rosa for Willow Nightingale which is a major upgrade, despite Willow and Penelope Ford having a less-than-excellent match tonight.

## Wrapping Up

The post-PPV Dynamite is usually filled to the brim with storyline beats which is always a ton of fun. These episodes don't always have the most wresting, but the wrestling that _is_ there is typically very good.

The exception tonight was the Brian Cage & Dralistico vs Powerhouse Hobbs & Hologram match. Much of it was good but there was also a _lot_ of sloppiness and clunkiness, a lot of it coming from Dralistico. Just felt like he was moving to a different rhythm than the other guys in the match.

I wasn't expecting to see the rift start to form within The Patriarchy. While Christian Cage rattled off excuses for why he didn't come out of Revolution as the World Champion, a fed up Nick Wayne told him to stop lying to himself, to the people, and to The Patriarchy. Christian intimidated Wayne up against a wall, trying to put his dear sweet son in his place before walking off.

I like Nick Wayne a lot and while his association with Christian has been fun, he's been floundering the way a lot of secondary stable members do in AEW (Daniel Garcia in JAS, Bryan Keith & Big Bill in The Learning Tree). If this is a chance for Wayne to step out and start doing more, then I'm all for it. Bonus points if we get Jordan Oliver in AEW as Wayne's partner to even the odds against Christian and Son Number Two, Kip Sabian.

Similarly, I wasn't expecting MJF's next beat to be with MVP and The Hurt Syndicate! MJF isn't someone who needs a mouthpiece, but who knows – MJF in The Hurt Syndicate could be an interesting little foray. I think The Hurt Syndicate are still _technically_ heels, so either we're getting them beefed up as _definitely_ heels with MJF in their ranks or we're going to see them turn face against MJF's refusal to accept MVP's help. OR a surprise third thing!

Next week we get Mercedes Moné vs Billie Starks which I can only imagine is the first step in getting Mercedes vs Athena for one or several titles at All In in Texas. I've got my fingers crossed that Athena leaves All In with more belts than she came in with and that she sticks around the AEW roster for the long haul. She's done everything in Ring of Honor (and is still the Women's Champion there) and it's time to do everything in AEW.

Collision is solidly stacked on Saturday with a bunch of matches already booked, so I'm looking forward to a return to form after the pre-PPV slump last week.
