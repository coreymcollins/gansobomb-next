excerpt: "Night two of Spring Break Thru on Collision didn't match up to the quality of wrestling on Dynamite, but it was still a fun two hours with a lot going on."

It's a two-night extravaganza with Spring Break Thru night two on a special Thursday Collision! The crowd was hot last night for a truly insane episode of television. I don't expect tonight to hold up in terms of in-ring quality, but I would be surprised if the crowd didn't push this from being a good show to a great show.

There aren't any matches with major implications tonight; instead, we're getting mostly some story building and teases for the rest of [The Owen Hart Cup](/posts/2025-04-02-write-forever-aew-dynamite).

[Josh Alexander](/posts/2025-04-16-write-forever-aew-dynamite), fresh off of his debut last night, will team with [Konosuke Takeshita](/posts/2025-01-04-write-forever-njpw-wrestle-kingdom-19) against Rocky Romero and Tomohiro Ishii. Elsewhere in the Family, Lance Archer wrestles Kevin Knight. Mercedes Moné and Harley Cameron rekindle their partnership against Julia Hart and Kris Statlander, and Adam Cole lays out the open challenge for the TNT Title.

## Motivated Death Riders are interesting Death Riders

The show opened up with an irate Marina Shafir hurling a stagehand around the ramp before the rest of the equally irate Death Riders billowed out of the crowd and into the ringside area. They threw more crew around, broke a camera, and generally made a real mess of the joint. It felt very reminiscent of the nWo taking over Nitro that one time, except it didn't last 40 minutes and kill the entire show.

Mox laid things out plain and simple on the mic – he's pissed at Samoa Joe, the man who made him pass out last night costing Death Riders the Trios Titles. Mox acknowledged that Joe has always been the baddest man in wrestling which was a nice touch. Joe has constantly been put over as a killer and a monster in a way that makes it easy to propel him to the top of the card and also makes it a big deal when someone beats him.

Mox cut to the chase by challenging Joe to a match for the World Heavyweight Title because, to paraphrase Mox, fighting Joe one-on-one for the belt is the only way he knows how to deal with his anger and frustration. I imagine this is our Double or Nothing main event.

This was great! It was all great! It isn't hard to make Death Riders and Moxley interesting. All you need is to let them look a little bit human. Let them lose, let their plans fall apart, and let them be vexed instead of always looking like the strongest people in every room.

The motivation behind Death Riders has always been a bit murky. Mox, at first, said he wanted to make the younger wrestlers step up and take things more seriously. This sort of happened with Private Party and Daniel Garcia, but then that went out the window with the Cope feud. So, the reasons for their methods have not always been consistent.

Give them some _real_ motivation, though, and they can deliver interesting characters and story beats. Lean into this more, please.

## ROPPONGI ROPPONGI LIGHTS ROPPONGI ROPPONGI VICE

ROPPONGI VICE IS BACK! Trent Beretta made his long-awaited (by me at least) return after a miscommunication between Rocky Romero and Tomohiro Ishii led to the team's downfall. With Ishii down post-match, the Don Callis Family returned to make things official, or so it seems – RPG Vice is now a part of the Don Callis Family.

Callis handed Trent a big ole wrench which he used to clobber Ishii about the head with. At least we know Ishii won't suffer any neck damage since he legally and medically does not have a neck.

This is a great way to bring Trent back onto TV and a fun thing to do with Rocky, who has always just buzzed around The Conglomeration when needed. Even if the team is short-lived, since who knows how often Rocky will be on AEW TV since he has a real-life job with New Japan, it should lead to some great tag team wrestling.

The Callis Family will certainly need some pruning when Mark Davis and Brian Cage are back, too, which means we could get some easy storyline reasons for cutting some folks out of the group when the time comes.

## Wrapping Up

Kevin Knight had another great showing, this time against Lance Archer. It's a shame Cage went down with an injury because Murder Machines were a lot of fun to watch. I'm afraid it's back to spinning wheels for Archer and eating losses until Cage is back in action.

Knight has been impressive and consistent since showing up in AEW and it seems like they know it. He's getting lots of chances to showcase everything he can do, and not just in squash matches like you sometimes get with a new face in wrestling. He's having long, back and forth matches with a _lot_ of really great people. There's no reason to think he can't stay this consistent, and if he does I could see him with the TNT Title before the year is up.

I'd like to formally request more Dramatic Readings of Letters by Tony Schiavone, please. He read an apology letter from FTR, who were suspended for a week without pay for attacking Tony on last week's Collision. I assume we'll get a big babyface moment for some team saving the day for Tony eventually, but who could it be? The Outrunners seem like a fair bet, but maybe Tony needs to call in some favors from the Rock 'N Roll Express or something just to be sure.

Adam Cole won his open challenge for the TNT Title against Claudio Castagnoli, who then went on a rampage destroying the ringside area while Wheeler Yuta and Jon Moxley tried to calm him down. It turns out, the way to make Death Riders interesting was just to make them dipshit losers! It's working!

During his entrance, Claudio haphazardly tossed a chair into the air and it smashed Nigel McGuinness on the knee at the commentary desk. So I guess this means the lines are drawn: Nigel has to get revenge on FTR for what they did to Tony Schiavone and Tony Schiavone has to get revenge on Claudio for what he did to Nigel.

While I tend to not enjoy having ROH stuff popping up on AEW TV, I can't complain about seeing Nick Wayne wrestle Komander – especially with Wayne walking away as the new ROH TV Champion! I'm looking forward to what comes next in the saga of The Patriarchy now that Wayne has done what Christian Cage wasn't able to do: secure a singles title for the group.
