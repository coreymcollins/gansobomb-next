Last night I watched _Harold and Maude_ and _Legend_ for the first time ever and I'm really looking forward to seeing what on Collision tonight will embody the spirits and emotions of both of those movies. Who is the odds-on-favorite to fall in love with someone 60 years older than them? Who is going to wear a top but no bottoms all night long? Who's going to start out looking like a normie but get gothed the fuck out and look way cooler before the end of the show?

All of these questions and more will be answered as we stroll on into a loaded, 8-match (but only one non-squash women's match per government mandate) Playoff Palooza edition of Collision!

## Treading water in hour one

Some weeks it's crystal clear that AEW's midcard is alive and well on an episode of Collision. This week, it felt like we were treading water for much of the first hour of the show.

Hologram answered Max Caster's open challenge, though it feels like we're still not sure where either man is going long-term. While Hologram has whipped up an impressive undefeated streak, it hasn't lead to anything more than just padding out his record with more wins on Collision.

Max Caster's whole deal seemed like it was in service of Anthony Bowens' return, but where does Max go now? He's still entertaining and far more enjoyable now than he was at the tail end of The Acclaimed's run, but at some point he's got to add something to the whole shtick. He's either got to figure out how to get some wins and/or add a manager to the mix who can help him get some wins.

I don't know why, exactly, we're getting a reboot on Jeff Jarrett and Jay Lethal. I don't know who needs or wants this. I just don't understand. There are _so many_ wrestlers on the roster who could be in whatever spot they wind up in and be _far_ more entertaining. There's simply no juice left to squeeze out of Jeff Jarrett â€“ we saw that in the horrible (and rightfully aborted) MJF feud.

As much as I like Top Flight and CRU in general, their feud has gone on for what feels like years at this point and has absolutely no heat. That's not really on them as much as it is on the booking for dragging this story on for months and months without resolving anything. The breakup was teased forever and then once they did break up, the payoff matches were teased forever.

Tonight we got an incredibly tame and surprisingly, considering who was in the ring, unexciting tornado tag match. I don't have faith that this is the true end of the feud, but I hope it is so both team can move onto doing literally anything else for a while.

## Collision was a one-match show

These preempted/delayed episodes of Collision always feel like a bit like filler episodes. The energy is always different though that could be due to the shows being taped in front of already exhausted crowds who have already seen a live Dynamite.

Either way, they never seem to load these episodes up the way live Collisions have been the past few months. The undercard was fairly underwhelming but the main event felt like a Collision of old: a long-ass tag team main event.

FTR are just exceptional as heels, it's a wonder that they've been babyfaces for so long in their AEW run. Their whole shtick just works better as heels, from the way they cut their promos to their in-ring style and their entire "tag team wrestling the way it used to be" attitude.

It still feels a bit like an odd couple pairing to put them with Stokely Hathaway, but I love Stokely Hathaway and the pure dipshit energy that will come off of the three of them together will soon become too powerful to argue against.

Paragon (a terrible name) looked great as they typically do, especially when out of the confines of the Adam Cole Zone. Cole does nothing for me, his TNT Title run is going to do nothing for me, and the second he gets involved in something with people I actually enjoy my interest begins to wane.

FTR won the match and looked to continue the beating after the bell, but Daniel Garcia made the save. I'm not entirely sold on Garcia's intentions being true. He, like FTR, is maybe more interesting and natural as a heel and I could see a trio of FTR and Garcia becoming three of the most hated wrestlers in AEW in quick fashion.

This match was also free of the odd miscommunication errors between Cash and Paragon which we saw last time the two wrestled [on March 15](/posts/2025-03-15-write-forever-aew-collision). All in all, a great main event topping out just over 20 minutes on a Collision that was otherwise quite missable. Thank you, FTR!

## Wrapping Up

It certainly looks like we're gearing up for either a Blood & Guts or Anarchy In The Arena match with The Elite versus some formation including, at the least, Swerve Strickland and Kenny Omega. I assume this is a marquee match for Double or Nothing as it seems clear that we're still on track for Omega/Okada at All In. Fingers crossed it's a title unification match so we can trim down the number of men's titles on the show and maybe, just maybe, open the door for women's tag titles?

Dralistico may have had his best singles match in AEW tonight against Bandido. I'm still staunchly against doing ROH stuff on AEW TV, but that's a complaint that's never going to be subdued since it seems inevitable that ROH feuds will always bleed over onto AEW shows.

I often find Dralistico to be a bit awkward and sloppy, but he was maybe his most consistent against Bandido. There were still some rough spots but nothing too jarring, just either slight miscommunications or mis-timings. That being said, if RUSH and Dralistico are still in support of Cuatrero after he was arrested for the attempted murder of Stephanie Vaquer then they can both fuck off forever.

This Collision felt like one to miss outside of the main event, but nothing on the show was actively bad. AEW has just given itself the problem of over-delivering in terms of quality more often than not on TV and PPV, so even a show that's simply "fine but not bad" stands out amongst the rest.
