It's another double dose of mid-week AEW with the ooky and kooky Thursday Collision! [Last night's Dynamite](/posts/2025-05-07-write-forever-aew-dynamite) was a breeze even with an MJF/Hurt People segment – every segment of the show felt like it mattered in some way or another because it drove a storyline forward.

Will we see the same tonight on Collision, or are we just in for the average "good wrestling but not a lot of movement" Collision that we tend to get when it's shifted around on the schedule?

We know for sure that there is a _lot_ more wrestling announced ahead of the show than we had for Dynamite which signals to me that we're going to be quite in-ring heavy with a possibility that we tread water on most of our stories.

I think the most we'll see move along tonight is the ongoing Daniel Garcia/FTR "You're not my real uncles!" story when Garcia meets one of the two in a singles match. Will they beat respect into Garcia or will he earn their respect and become the fourth member of the FTR & Stokely Hathaway polycule? There's only one way to find out!

## Thursday is okay for fighting

These off-schedule Collisions are definitely falling into a certain category of programming for me. There's often not anything extraordinary on any of these episodes, but also nothing bad. It's like a fine and easy-to-watch couple of hours but nothing that you need to go out of your way to see.

I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. On one hand, do you want to give away any of your super exciting stuff when your show happens at an unusual time or on an unusual day? On the other hand, do you want to try and entice viewers to make sure they definitely don't miss the show when it's getting bopped around like this?

For me, it turns out to be a series of shows that aren't really easy to find anything to write about. Last night's Dynamite had, I think, three matches booked by the time the show went on the air. Tonight's Collision had seven. That leaves little room for anything other than in-ring action, most of which was just fine-to-good.

We did get a bit of development in the world of the Gates of Agony and The Learning Tree, who brawled around the ring for a bit before going through some tables. I love the Gates of Agony being on TV more often and I love Bryan Keith and Big Bill doing something more serious without being lackeys to Chris Jericho.

## Willow Nightingale & Kris Statlander: not yet friends, again

On last night's Dynamite, Kris Statlander tried again to make amends with Willow Nightingale who wasn't having any of it. Willow didn't want to talk and said she'd rather fight it out in the ring.

Tonight they got that chance and, shock of all shocks, they had an excellent match! Why aren't they both on TV doing this every week?! One of life's great mysteries.

Over the years Stat has really beefed up and tightened up her offense, all of which makes her so incredibly dynamic in the ring. She hit a couple of vertical suplexes on Willow on the floor that were just as beautiful as they were gnarly.

Willow, not to be outdone, muscled Stat up for The Babe With The Powerbomb which isn't something she often has to do. The women's division doesn't have as deep of a meat subdivision as the men's division does, and Willow doesn't usually have to do extra work to get someone up like that.

As Stat rolled out of the ring following the powerbomb, Marina Shafir interfered to lay Willow out while Wheeler Yuta (that little shit) distracted the referee. As the pair exited, Stat reentered the ring and put Willow away for the win.

Stat, of course, had nothing to do with the interference... right? Her past with Wheeler Yuta is just that and she didn't put the fix in against a stubborn Willow – or did she? I'm leaning more toward doubt on this one with the uncertainty driving more of a wedge between Willow and Stat for a little while longer.

Eventually, we have to get to the Willow/Marina factory and if I had to put money on it, I'd say we get Stat thwarting interference from Wheeler Yuta to even the odds and lead Willow to victory – paving the way for a friendship restored.

I love this story! I mean, I love the people in it. Stat turning babyface in a weird backstage segment was bad and short-sighted, but I have enjoyed her attempts to win back Willow's friendship.

## One step closer to Nigel McGuinness vs FTR

In the main event, Daniel Garcia bloodied Dax Harwood in an excellent singles match. When Cash Wheeler tried getting involved, Daddy Magic was there to put a stop to things and level the playing field a bit for Garcia.

The fight went into the crowd and past the announcer's station, drawing the fear of Tony Schiavone and the ire of Nigel McGuinness. While Nigel tried to play it cool, Dax knocked his headset off of him and shoved him in an attempt to antagonize him into a fist fight. Nigel, though, stayed at the desk.

Once the match got back into the ring, Garcia went to put Dax away with a piledriver but Stokely Hathaway caused some interference to take Garcia's attention away. With the referee distracted by Stokely, Nigel rushed the ring and stopped Dax from hitting his own piledriver on Garcia.

Nigel then launched an attack on Dax, and the returning Cash, while Daddy Magic _also_ returned to help run FTR out of the ring completely.

Anything that gets Nigel McGuinness back in the ring is fine by me! Nigel and Garcia vs FTR? Sign me the hell up? We could even get an FTR & Stokely vs Garcia, Daddy Magic, & Nigel trios match out of this which would also be a delight.

Is this all leading to Garcia eventually embracing his evil side and joining FTR? With each brutal fight, I see the possibility dropping lower and lower. It's one thing to have a war of words for show and then turn to the dark side – it's another thing completely to beat each other bloody and then still decide to turn on your friends.

But we'll see! There's still more to this story and heel FTR have been a delight, so I'm on board.

## Athena's Dropkick Power Rankings

Tonight, Anthony Bowens threw Lee Johnson into the video barricade. We also saw Daniel Garcia dropkick Dax Harwood against the video barricade. The video barricade did not break into static. We can now update our Athena's Dropkick Power Rankings thusly:

1. Athena's Dropkick (victim: Mercedes Moné)
2. (Tied For Last) Brody King splashing people into the barricade; Hangman Adam Page throwing Kyle Fletcher into the barricade; Samoa Joe and Claudio Castagnoli whipping each other into the barricade; Anthony Bowens throwing Lee Johnson into the video barricade; Daniel Garcia dropkicking Dax Harwood against the video barricade

## Wrapping Up

Tonight, someone remembered Grizzled Young Vets existed and put them in a backstage segment with Paragon in a battle to see which team has the worst name. If only Paragon had a catchphrase, they could fight over who had the worst one of those, too.

The match should be fine if not good-to-very-good, but it's funny to see GYV pop up out of nowhere after having a couple matches and then disappearing to the ROH Dimension. Maybe this is Tony testing the waters to see if they can demonstrate some semblance of a personality on TV.

Last night we got a surprise appearance by Rhino and tonight we got a surprise appearance by Zach Gowen, who had his prosthetic leg stolen by the dastardly Ricochet. Gowen was a lightning-in-a-bottle sensation in the early 2000s and since I haven't heard of him turning out to be a huge piece of shit like wrestlers love to do, I was happy to see him make an appearance and get a sweet little pop.

Later on in the night, it was announced that next week on Dynamite Ricochet will wrestle Zach Gowen. Tony Khan is a madman.

Whenever Anthony Bowens is on screen they should run the five tools along the bottom of the screen like a stock ticker.

As always, RUSH and Dralistico can fuck off forever until I find out that they've come to their senses and no longer support attempted murderer El Cuatrero.
