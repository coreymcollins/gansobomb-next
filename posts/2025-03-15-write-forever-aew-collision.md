The International Title Eliminator Tournament continues tonight with Ricochet vs Katsuyori Shibata and the battle of the Marks as Davis faces Briscoe. On [Dynamite](/posts/2025-03-12-write-forever-aew-dynamite), "Speedball" Mike Bailey and Orange Cassidy advanced to the finals so whoever joins them will ensure a fun-as-hell four-way match this Wednesday.

We also get a rematch from [a couple of weeks ago](/posts/2025-03-01-write-forever-aew-collision) of Undisputed Kingdom vs FTR. Will FTR continue to have attitude problems and refuse to shake hands? Will Dax Harwood continue to make bad decisions like asking for a match to be restarted after having won the match? Only time will tell!

After a Dynamite loaded with storyline next-steps and resets, Collision has a lot to live up to. Let's all settle in with Elton John and see what happens next.

## The Eliminator continues to eliminate

Shibata got one of the all-timer Ricochet slaps-on-the-bald-head in history. We all spent the past few days wondering how he'd work it into his repertoire, and baby, he did not disappoint. Masterful stuff.

The match itself was fine but was neither Ricochet or Shibata's best work. Ricochet got the win through dirty means, using the ropes for leverage on a pinfall. On this St. Patrick's Day weekend, it was clear Ric O'Chet had the luck of the Irish on his side.

Mark Davis has the ideal pro-wrestler body type and Nigel McGuinness is fully aware of this. Tonight, he made reference to Davis "big fat dumper", which Davis used exceedingly well in flattening Briscoe with multiple sentons tonight. Give me a roster full of guys built like Davis, JD Drake, Evil Uno, and Big Beef.

They don't share an in-ring style, but I've been thinking a lot about Scott Norton lately and Davis is maybe the most Norton-esque physically in AEW and I appreciate that.

The crowd woke up quite a bit more for Briscoe/Davis than they did for Ricochet/Shibata and with the help of Murder Machines and his own big fat dumper, Davis pulled out the win over Briscoe. The Don Callis Family now has a man on the inside: a Family member in the finals of a tournament whose winner will challenge Kenny Omega at Dynasty.

Can Davis move on to Dynasty to try and exact some revenge on Omega for taking the International Title from Konosuke Takeshita at [Revolution](/posts/2025-03-09-write-forever-aew-revolution)? I don't see it happening, personally, but every wrestler in the four-way final would have an excellent match against Omega so there's no real wrong way to go.

## A tag team main event not without its problems

FTR had an unusually sloppy match with Undisputed Kingdom, at least on the Cash Wheeler side. I'm not sure if it was just a lack of chemistry between Wheeler and Roderick Strong or something else, but I don't remember there being so many missteps in their first encounter a couple of weeks back.

Cash was all over the place for several minutes in this one, having a weird miscommunication in the corner as Roddy charged in and then throwing Roddy face-first into the face of Dax Harwood standing on the apron. I'm not sure how you miss the turnbuckle and hit your partner's face instead, but Cash managed to do it.

Soon after this, Wheeler almost steamrolled the referee charging across the ring and followed that up by getting all sorts of turned around holding Roddy up for a Hart Attack, visibly unsure of which direction he should be facing in the ring.

Odd stuff from a team that is usually perfectly on point.

Aside from that, there was some good visual storytelling in the match. After a Steiner Brothers-esque Doomsday Bulldog from FTR, Dax covered Kyle O'Reilly close to the ropes but made sure to not only hook the leg closest to the rope but to grab the arm closest to the rope as well. A nice callback to the false finish from their previous match that ended (before being restarted) with Dax getting the pin with KOR's foot on the rope.

In the end FTR won the match with a Shatter Machine on Roddy. This match served a couple of purposes: a chance for the teams to put the questions of two weeks ago behind them and, with Daniel Garcia and Adam Cole on commentary, serving as a background to next week's TNT Title rematch between Garcia and Cole.

Post-match, FTR refused a handshake for the second time despite Garcia and Cole, nose to nose, shaking hands ahead of their return bout. Garcia looked a little perturbed at the lack of sportsmanship of FTR but did leave with them when all was said and done.

As FTR were leaving, Wheeler indicated to Undisputed Kingdom that they were one and one now. Perhaps we'll get a rubber match down the road in the form of a two-out-of-three-falls match which should be spectacular if Wheeler is on his game.

## Wrapping Up

In a quick backstage segment, Toni Storm essentially accepted the non-verbal challenge of Megan Bayne. Later in the show, Bayne defeated Thunder Rosa in one of Rosa's better matches since coming back from injury.

Bayne kept the pressure on Rosa with an Argentine Backbreaker after the match before Toni Storm made the save. Bayne made short work of Storm, though, dropping her with her Fate's Descent F5 before being run-off by Kris Statlander, who Bayne will meet on Dynamite.

As I said in the Dynamite write-up, I don't necessarily know that it's the right time for Bayne to challenge Storm unless you go for the shock upset and have Bayne win the belt. It feels too early in her run to have Bayne eat a loss, even if it is to the World Champion. Nonetheless, I'm looking forward to seeing what they can do together.

Lots of squashes tonight, but squashes with a little bit of story mixed into the post-match. After Powerhouse Hobbs squashed Griff Garrison, The Frat House tried jumping Hobbs with The Outrunners making the save. After a Murder Machines squash, Mark Briscoe stopped the duo from doing more damage before needing the help of Powerhouse Hobbs.

In a standby match, Top Flight and Hologram defeated The Infantry and Lee Moriarty while CRU (Lio Rush & Action Andretti) watched on from the ramp. The whole Top Flight/CRU thing has been about as long and meandering as the breakup of The Acclaimed but maybe things will actually start moving again. There are so many fun tag teams in AEW who just get pushed to the wayside, and it'd be great to see teams like CRU, Top Flight, and The Infantry get used more consistently on TV.

All that to say â€“ there are a lot of moving pieces in the AEW midcard which is always a positive!

Next week's Collision is spread over Saturday _and_ Sunday, airing at 11PM at the earliest each night. I will not be writing about Collision next week because I'm an old man who loves to sleep.
