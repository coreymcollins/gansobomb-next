Last night I watched _Titanic_ for the first time ever. Tonight, Dynamite becomes the longest-running wrestling show on a Turner network. Two equally momentous events!

Tonight on Dynamite we'll get the long-awaited Mercedes Moné vs Athena match in The Owen. Athena coming to AEW TV after being ROH's Forever Champ for... well... _ever_ has been fantastic. Slotting her into a feud with Mercedes immediately has been even better.

The Trios Titles are on the line with substitutions and omissions all around; Jon Moxley will take the place of the injured PAC and Hook, now missing in action, is out of the match leaving us with a 3-on-2 title match in favor of Death Riders.

Konosuke Takeshita and Will Ospreay face off in further Owen Hart Cup action, and we finally find out who the wild card is against "Hangman" Adam Page.

Plus, The Gates of Agony challenge The Hurt People for the Tag Team Titles which should be fun in a "huge dudes hitting each other hard" kind of way, and I'm sure we'll get some kind of next step in the ongoing MVP/MJF saga.

It feels like a big night for Dynamite, so let's get into it!

## Instant classics in The Owen

Was it a surprise? No. Did it somehow exceed expectations while still leaving a lot on the table for future matches? Absolutely. Mercedes Moné vs Athena kicked off the show in excellent fashion going 20+ minutes in the semi-finals of The Owen Hart Cup tournament.

I was taken aback when they announced the tournament and saw Mercedes and Athena on the same side of the brackets. With the story building they've been doing, I imagined we'd see the two of them in the finals. Instead, we got a Mercedes win leading to her facing the winner of Kris Statlander and Jamie Hayter.

And what becomes of Athena? I don't think she's done with Mercedes. I initially thought we'd see her play a part in the outcome of the tournament finals in some way, but I've been waffling back and forth on what I think the World Title match will be at All In. The big money is on Toni Storm vs Mercedes, but that leaves Athena out in the cold on a huge show in her home state. I'll happily wait and see on this one.

In another tournament match, the wild card was revealed to be the debuting Josh Alexander. Ole Hanger wouldn't be denied, though, sneaking a win with a small package after an excellent match. This was a great first showing for Alexander who had a lot of crowd support to counter Hangman throughout the entirety of the match.

Post-match, Don Callis and Kyle Fletcher came out to cause bad boy trouble and after Hangman disposed of Fletcher, Alexander laid Page out from behind with a big forearm. Alexander left by himself while Callis and Fletcher stood over the fallen Hangman, so maybe the jury is still out – but it certainly looks like Callis has picked up an injury replacement for Mark Davis (though Alexander has no big fat dumper).

## MJF still struggles to find a balance

The ongoing MJF/Hurt People saga continued tonight with a post-match back and forth between MJF and his hopeful stablemates. He did the sleazeball thing of throwing women at the group as a way to convince them to let him join and then threw gifts, in the form of his wristwatch, at them as well.

It's always better when women aren't objectified and treated like objects, so that part of the segment felt a bit out of place in AEW where this sort of stuff doesn't typically happen. But, the stuff that typically _doesn't_ happen in AEW typically _does_ happen in MJF segments.

At least nobody called them derogatory names, as MJF is often want to do, so that's progress? I don't know.

The segment felt like it dragged forever, which turned out to be 8 minutes or so. They could have done the same thing in about half the time. It's not like they lost the crowd or anything, but watching on TV it just felt like it kept going and going and going.

Later on, The Hurt People seemed to _sort of_ agree to let MJF into the group with the caveat that Lashley would hurt him (and MVP would eject him) if he proved to be more trouble than he's worth.

In a match that could have been a main event on any PPV of the year, Will Ospreay defeated Konosuke Takeshita to lock in as a finalist in the men's Owen Hart Cup. There's not much more you can say other than _what a fucking match_. Ospreay seems poised to be the guy to take the World Title from Jon Moxley (please let it all end at All In) and Takeshita is so easily a main event/World Title guy alongside him that it isn't even funny.

Ospreay has a lot of fuel in the tank for career-feuds with Kyle Fletcher, Mark Davis, Takeshita, and even non-Callis guys like Kenny Omega, Kazuchika Okada, and a more seasoned Kevin Knight down the road. Aside from Omega and Okada (who are closer to the ends of their careers than the beginnings), these guys are who the future of AEW should be built upon.

If Ospreay becomes World Champ, it opens up an entirely new world of possible challengers – and while some of those challengers may be repeat opponents, they will be fresh main event match-ups. Do the needful, Tony Khan. Get that god damn belt off of Jon Moxley.

## The beginning of the end of Death Riders

Well, they did it. They finally fucking did it!

When The Opps (awful name) became the team who was setting their sights on Death Riders, it felt like it was finally time to shake things up and move the Trios Titles out of the death grip of Death Riders. But then, it all started to go wrong.

PAC got injured, meaning he would be replaced in the Trios Title match by World Champion Jon Moxley. At that point, I started to doubt that they'd actually drop the belts without PAC being involved.

Then, it was announced at the start of Dynamite that Hook would no longer be in the match due to an undisclosed medical issue so it would be 3-on-2 in favor of Death Riders. I quickly felt the positive feelings begin to slip even further.

The surprises didn't end there, though. After The Opps made their entrance (awful theme), they paused at the entrance. Why? To allow their replacement for Hook, Powerhouse Hobbs, to make his entrance. The good feelings began to rise again.

I didn't think there was any way this match could live up to the match that came before it (Ospreay/Takeshita) and it _didn't_ from a technical standpoint, but from a "being fun to watch" standpoint? Yes, it absolutely did.

Things started fast and didn't slow down much the length of the match. The Opps seemed to have things in fairly firm control until those dastardly Young Bucks made their way to the ring. The Bucks, eager to impress Death Riders, sauntered around the ring and began to gather chairs to presumably help Death Riders retain their belts.

Honestly, I just felt deflated when the Bucks came out because I've become so used to Death Riders interference bullshit that it just felt unfun and annoying – and not in a "the booking got me!" kind of way.

But then, out of the crowd, Swerve Strickland laid waste to Matthew & Nicholas with a Swerve Stomp and a couple of tosses into the crowd. The booking got me!

As Mox wound up to use another chair, Willow Nightingale appeared to rip it away from him and flip him the bird to raucous applause.

With the match descending into madness all around, Joe countered Mox's attempt at the Death Rider DDT into the Coquina Clutch forcing a referee stoppage for the submission win giving us brand new Trios Champions!

Lead by Will Ospreay, a chunk of the locker room entered the ring to celebrate with The Opps (and Hobbs). This felt like the feel-good moment of Lex Luger defeating Hollywood Hogan for the World Title on Nitro all those years ago, and I hope the feeling lasts longer this time around.

I do wonder about Hook, though. I'm not sure what kept him out tonight but I'll be curious to see how they spin this down the road. Is Hobbs officially an Opp now? Will Hook have any ill will toward Joe or Shibata after effectively being replaced by Hobbs? Or am I just injecting 40 years of standard wrestling bullshit into a story that may not even be a story at all?

I could see Hook turning on The Opps and replacing PAC (for now) in Death Riders to regain the Trios Titles, which wouldn't be my favorite thing in the world – but, at least for tonight, it felt good to finally see Death Riders fall.

## Wrapping Up

The Hurt Syndicate had a fun match with The Gates of Agony for the Tag Team Titles, retaining the belts in a non-surprising outcome. I like The Gates a lot and they've approved a ton since they started here in AEW. I almost always enjoy them when they pop up; Toa Leona is still a little rough around the edges but Bishop Kaun more than makes up for it. I'd love to see them become more of a fixture on the show.

The main event felt like a turning point, though I'm sure Death Riders will find a way to get the Trios Titles back sooner than later from the ramshackle group of The Opps + Will Hobbs. I've gotten so used to Death Riders interference sucking all of the wind out of main events that I felt the same suck when The Young Bucks appeared.

A fool I was, though. The schmozz of all schmozzes occurred but this time the good guys came out on top. The pops for Willow, Swerve, and the eventual victory all felt so cathartic. Great fucking show, great fucking main event, incredible goofball stuff that worked out _this time_. Hell of an ending.
