Sometimes life gets in the way of writing your bullshit about professional wrestling, and life got in the way the past couple of weeks. But we're here now with an AEW PPV and a full-week's staycation to look forward to, with one last Dynamite left to go!

The announced matches are few and far between for tonight's show with a lot of the card made up of talking segments to build toward Double or Nothing. And you better believe we're getting another [MJF/Hurt](/posts/2025-04-30-write-forever-aew-dynamite) People segment so we can drag that shit out even more! Thank god!

Over the past few episodes I've not written about, we've seen the drama build between [Will Ospreay and Hangman Page](/posts/2025-04-30-write-forever-aew-dynamite) and Mercedes Moné and Jamie Hayter ahead of their Owen Hart Cup finals and tonight will (probably) be the final stop for those four before Sunday's PPV.

It's Wednesday and that's almost as good a night for fighting as Saturday – let's go, girls!

## A long, long opening segment

Will Ospreay was back at it again with his god damned straight hair and I've had enough of it! For months I'd been sure that Ospreay was being built up as the guy to win The Owen and unseat Jon Moxley as World Champion. Not only has the story with Hangman Page started to plant seeds of doubt in my head, but Ospreay's desire for straight, 90's teen boy hair has almost entirely soured me on the idea.

Hangman Page, standing there with natural curls cropped shaggily falling onto the shoulders of a western button-up decorated with flowers, has earned his spot as the winner of The Owen and the next AEW World Champion.

In all honesty, I think I'm fine with whoever wins the tournament and will be happy with either guy taking the belt off of Moxley (_finally_). Ospreay seems like a more realistic choice with Forbidden Door in London coming up, but the story arc of Hangman may eclipse Ospreay's potential victory.

This segment felt like it went on just a bit too long. I'm never a fan of a show opening with a long talking segment; too much 2000s WWE programming will do that to a person. They probably both could have gotten their points across more quickly, and the crowd didn't really seem like they were hanging on every word the way they may have hoped – Ospreay especially.

The crowd respectfully popped for certain lines, but they were also somewhat respectfully quiet for much of the segment which didn't give this the gravitas it perhaps deserved. There was a certain electricity that was missing. It's possible the crowd simply didn't know who to cheer for and didn't necessarily want to boo either man. I don't see this being a problem once they actually get into the ring on Sunday, though.

## A succinct final build to the women's Owen Hart Cup

I don't think there's much up in the air about how the women's Owen Hart Cup finals go on Sunday. If they're not building to Mercedes Moné vs Toni Storm at the biggest show of the year, then I'd be incredibly surprised. I wouldn't hate it! I'd just be very surprised.

Tonight, Jamie Hayter and Mercedes got their own talking segment to build to their match at Double or Nothing. Styled a little differently, sitting in chairs under spotlights in the center of the ring and moderated by Renee Paquette, Hayter and Moné traded barbs back and forth briefly.

Hayter cuts a measured, determined promo. She's maybe one of the most confident women on the mic in all of AEW. She said in her promo that she may be rough around the edges, but that's not truly how she comes off when she's cutting an impassioned promo. It's easy to believe what she says even if it doesn't come with a ton of flair or bombasity.

Mercedes deviated from her usual mode and cut a more focused, serious promo against Jamie rather than hitting the usual CEO high notes of yelling the name of the city she's in or leading the crowd in CEO chants. Earlier, Jamie pondered what would come next for her if she lost at Double or Nothing; Mercedes hit back saying that she was going to end Hayter's story on Sunday.

To retort, Hayter mentioned Mercedes' recent loss of the NJPW Strong Women's Championship suggesting that the CEO is fallible after all. Mercedes launched into an attach but ended up eating the Hayterade lariat to wrap the segment.

They did this in much less time but with just as much, if not more, impact than the men's opening segment. You don't need 20 minutes of talking if you're able to hit your points hard and quickly without a ton of added fluff. This may be the match I'm looking forward to most on Sunday, and if Hayter loses I'm hoping there are definitive and clear plans for her going forward because it'd be a shame for her to get lost in the shuffle without a match solidified for All In.

## Wrapping Up

Shows since someone didn't say "bitch" during an MJF or Hurt People segment: 0

The whole MJF/Hurt People segment just sucked absolute ass. Nothing new, of course! I generally like MVP but he tends to run his mouth way too much in the ring going for not only the cheapest heat possible but also derailing the momentum of segments by interrupting people near-constantly. It's so annoying.

When we got the thumbs up last week, I thought that was finally the end of this whole will they/won't they deal and we'd finally get to move onto a more robust story. Nope! Gotta sign a contract and gotta do it in the ring and gotta make pained faces while doing it! Plus we need to get in a rambling, clunky Dustin Rhodes promo – proof that MJF & The Hurt People can drag down anybody and any segment that gets attached to them. Great work, guys!

Anthony Bowens should stop doing the scissor thing now that The Acclaimed are long dead. Instead, he should put all five fingers into the air and instead of scissoring Billy Gunn they should do the "this is the church, this is the steeple" thing with their hands.

I don't know what changed about Mina Shirakawa, but I've enjoyed her two matches since returning to AEW much more than I enjoyed any of the matches in her previous run. I can't say for sure what it is – it felt like perhaps she was holding back a bit before? This version of Mina is hitting harder and wrestling tighter.

Mina and Julia Hart in the main event was the absolute correct choice to close this show out. They kept the crowd in the palm of their hands the entire match and the post-match did a lot to add more intrigue to the match on Sunday, which required a bit of a quick build with the number one contender only coming into the picture last Saturday.

Plus, everyone was reminded of the relationship between Julia Hart and Skye Blue which is also a plus! Skye's adjacency to the House of Black/Hounds of Hell is a fun bit of character work and something we don't always get to see in wrestling, where for ages it was always "you're either in the group or against the group." Sometimes, though, you just get to be friends with someone who has other friends and that's nice, too.

A wrestling-lite episode of Dynamite but not a bad or boring show by any means! As usual, lots of moving parts and build toward Double or Nothing including a show-ending brawl to preview Anarchy in the Arena. Collision comes tomorrow with a ton of matches announced, so expect more fun wrestling and maybe less story build for DoN.
