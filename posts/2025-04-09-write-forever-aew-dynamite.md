It's the fallout from [AEW Dynasty](/posts/2025-04-06-write-forever-aew-dynasty)! Dynasty was a show that was basically great, but had two real black eyes: Jon Moxley retaining the World Heavyweight Title and a tremendously boring Adam Cole/Daniel Garcia TNT Title match which ground the entire show to halt.

Tonight, what answers will we get? Will we hear from [The Young Bucks](/posts/2024-04-10-write-forever-aew-dynamite) about their motives for helping Moxley retain the title? Will we get some insight into FTR after their exceptional heel turn on Adam Copeland? And who will get closer to winning The Owen and facing the World Champions at All In?

WEEEELLLLLL, it's a big show!

## The Young Bucks made their elevator pitch

After what was a fine but unremarkable Jon Moxley/Katsuyori Shibata match, The Young Bucks sauntered out to the ring to jibber jabber with Moxley before the World Champion and Marina Shafir exited.

On the mic, The Bucks said that they did what they did for two reasons: for their friend (whom they love, and whom they know loves them back) Adam Page and as an olive branch to Death Riders. They called Mox back out to discuss an ongoing, synergistic partnership but were instead greeted by Kenny Omega.

Omega tossed a few insults out at The Bucks before saying he was ready to fight right now. But, as Omega prepared to enter the ring, the coin dropped and Kazuchika Okada entered. Not to be outdone, Swerve Strickland came in from the crowd to send The Elite backing up the ramp.

Swerve and Kenny exchanged a fist bump and Swerve began cutting a promo on The Bucks before he was jumped by PAC, leading into their match.

But let's dissect everything that happened! This was a lot in a relatively short amount of time. The Bucks have laid it out on the line that they wanted to help Adam Page â€“ but did ole Hanger want that help anymore? And, further, after finding some kind of disturbing common ground with Swerve on Dynamite, do Hangman's intentions still include "Swerve Strickland can never be AEW World Champion again"?

Later in the show, a crazed Hangman (a redundant phrase) was storming through the locker room looking for Swerve. He found Nana and shouted at him that his intentions were _definitely_ to hit Swerve with the Buckshot on Sunday. As Hangman left, Nana began to apologize not on behalf of Swerve but on behalf of himself before Hangman abruptly cut him off and told him that he doesn't get to do that. Hangman left as quickly as he came with no sign of Swerve.

We saw at Dynasty that Hangman was conflicted as he setup for the Buckshot Lariat, unsure as to whether he should hit Swerve or Moxley. Will he see The Bucks' efforts as a favor or a mistake? And, were their intentions true to begin with?

Tonight, we got involvement from a lot of people splitting the sides: The Bucks and Okada vs Omega and Swerve. Hangman didn't make his presence known in the group segment, but will he stack the deck alongside The Elite or even the odds _against_ them, defying all of his own frazzled logic?

## They hurt people('s feelings)

The Hurt People had a little celebration for retaining their Tag Team Titles at Dynasty which was, as expected, interrupted by MJF. It seems like the crowd has babyfaced MJF again and I'm not sure how I feel about that yet. As long as he doesn't tread into goofball territory like the Brochachos days I think I can accept it.

MJF talked long and loudly about how great it was to be out there as part of The Hurt Syndicate since he helped them on Sunday, and that now that they're working together they can help him win the World Title again.

He was cut off by Lashley and the two sparred verbally before MVP put things to a vote. MVP voted yes, but Shelton Benjamin voted no meaning that MJF in The Hurt People was just never going to happen.

MJF seemed truly dejected, telling the camera to get out of his face, and I have to wonder how much of this is an act and how much if it is MJF actually having a soul and human feelings again. Is he just playing with MVP and plotting something in the background? Or did he actually think he was going to fall in with the group?

It'd be interesting to see MJF find a tag team partner he actually likes and gun for Shelton & Lashley. Or, does he recruit a whole-ass tag team to stable up with once again and send the team after the Tag Team Champions?

This is an intriguing time for the MJF character, especially coming off of the heels of a truly horrific and short-lived Jeff Jarrett feud. They quickly pivoted to a Dustin Rhodes feud and then to this, which feels fresh for the former World Champion.

## Wrapping Up

By all accounts, PAC injured something in his right leg possibly on a buckle bomb from Swerve Strickland in their match tonight. PAC pretty quickly rolled out of the ring and was tended to by the ringside doctor before eventually getting into the ring and eating a kick to the mush + a Swerve Stomp to quickly end things. Decided not to include that in the match rankings since it went off the rails fairly quickly due to the injury; it doesn't seem fair to rate it low because of a freak accident.

Here's hoping PAC isn't out too long and everything was more precautionary than anything else, but I'm not betting on that being the case. I've never been a huge fan of blind-bump moves, but that's especially the case after what happened with Shinjiro Otani. There's just not really a need for them, and half of the time they don't land clean anyway.

In the main event, Samoa Joe & Hook defeated Claudio Castagnoli & Wheeler Yuta after a failed interference attempt from Mox (assume this was meant to be PAC). After the customary Death Riders beatdown on Hook, Joe and Shibata ran them off and then officially challenged for the Trios Titles. Seems like the time is right to start chipping away at Death Riders' grip on titles, especially now that PAC has gone down with an injury.

We got the biggest development for The Learning Tree in _months_ as Jericho lost his marbles and destroyed another television in the middle of a wrestling ring, dropping an f-bomb along the way. Jericho (repeatedly) voiced his disappointment in Big Bill and Bryan Keith before saying it was time for him to go.

I hope this becomes a bit of a refocus for Bill and Keith because they're both extremely good, Keith especially. I'd love less goofboy Bad Apple stuff and more serious Bounty Hunter wrecking everyone's asses stuff.

It's a positive that Jericho, seemingly, will be off of TV for a while. He's great at retooling himself and always finds his flow eventually, but he also tends to overstay his welcome. Going away for a bit could do a lot of goodwill for Jericho, and I wouldn't be surprised to see him come back in a couple of months with a fresh new character that we all dislike at first and then grow to like (and then grow to dislike again).
