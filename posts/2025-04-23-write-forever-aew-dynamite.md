Fresh off of something interesting finally happening with Death Riders, it's time for an AEW Dynamite with not much announced ahead of time. Tonight we'll see Jamie Hayter and Kris Statlander in the semi-finals of the Owen Hart Cup to see who wrestles Mercedes Moné in the finals as well as "Speedball" Mike Bailey & Kevin Knight taking on The Young Bucks.

Both of those matches should be great! But, I always prefer and love when we get a fully stacked card announced days in advance.

AEW was busy on socials today also announcing Brody King & Will Ospreay vs Konosuke Takeshita & Josh Alexander and Mark Briscoe vs Ricochet.

And Master P! For some reason! For WCW reasons? I don't know! Let's find out!

## Stokely Hathaway finally found his tag team

I'm not going to pretend that I understand it yet. FTR and Stokely Hathaway aren't a combination that I would ever think of putting together. Generally, FTR are good-to-great promos depending on the feud and material. Dax carries that side of things more than Cash, but they're not a team that I've ever thought needed a mouthpiece.

Stokely, of course, is just incredible in all that he does. The last we saw him, he was trying to find a tag team. I think we got one vignette of him reviewing some matches and then a few failed attempts at courting Top Flight before he disappeared.

Today, April 23, 2025, Stokely Hathaway finally found his tag team.

FTR welcomed the Rock 'N Roll Express into the ring before, predictably, murdering them via spike piledriver on Ricky Morton. They were chased off by The Paragon, which I understand – if I were on the show and saw Adam Cole coming, I would also run to avoid being the same segment as him. I guess this means we'll get to run back FTR/Roddy & Kyle at some point. Here's hoping it stays together a bit more than their last match!

I do think it's time for someone to have a talk with the Rock 'N Roll Express, though. Almost every time they show up on an AEW show, someone beats their asses. Is someone forcing them into it? Have their brains been scrambled to the point that they don't remember what happens at each show? Someone please help those old men :(

## The Young Bucks: pretty good wrestlers!

The Young Bucks made their return to the ring against the duo of "Speedball" Mike Bailey and Kevin Knight tonight. To the surprise of nobody, the match whipped ass! The Bucks looked incredible in their first match back in AEW while Bailey and Knight continued to look like huge deals.

The lovely thing about The Bucks? They don't mind eating losses so it felt as possible for them to win this match as it felt for them to lose this match.

The other lovely thing about The Bucks? They're incredible and haven't skipped a beat!

In the end, it was Ricochet who would cost Knight and Bailey the match – specifically by distracting Knight as revenge for Knight stopping Ricochet from stabbing Mark Briscoe to death with scissors earlier in the night.

It appears that Kevin Knight has found his first singles feud and I can't think of a better person to have it with. Ricochet has been on fire for months and Knight came into AEW with a rocket strapepd to his back. I'm very much looking forward to the singles match between those two.

## I think I'm just not that into The Hurt People

Maybe I'm an outlier. Maybe it's just the storyline with MJF. But, something about me is just not clicking with The Hurt People are in the ring cutting promos. Give me Shelton Benjamin matches all day long! I'd love that!

Maybe they feel too generic? Like too prototypical "we're gonna beat up and hurt everybody" without much spice or character work? In a company full of wrestlers who are either over-the-top characters or absolutely insane in the ring, Lashley falls devastatingly short for me.

I'm not throwing in the towel completely. I want to get through this never-ending saga with MJF and then see how I'm feeling. At the moment, though, the main thing they're hurting is my interest in their segments and matches.

## Wrapping Up

I don't know what you can say about the opening segment of the show. It was an absolute fever dream, but great! Tony Schiavone introduced Master P who introduced The Opps to celebrate their Trios Titles win. This brought out Death Riders for the attack, but they were thwarted and laid out by The Opps – until The Elite arrived to break things up – until Swerve Strickland arrived to chase The Bucks up the ramp – until Kenny Omega arrived to chase The Bucks out into the crowd. Pure chaos!

Joe made his intentions known after the fracas: he wants Mox's World Championship, and he'll get his shot May 14 in Chicago. But how will this sit with Swerve Strickland who has also had his focus on Mox's belt? And what of Hook when he eventually returns? Lots of threads in this story and lots of ways to see everything come together!

"Lots of threads" seemed to be the theme tonight with one segment bleeding into the next all night long. It's nice when this happens; it makes the show feel cohesive and like everything that happens on the show isn't happening in a vacuum of its own little segment. It also makes the show feel like it flies by, which it certainly did tonight.

In the main event, Jamie Hayter beat Kris Statlander to advance to teh finals of the Owen Hart Cup against Mercedes Moné. It wasn't everything I wished it would have been, but it was totally fine and got better as the match went on. Hayter and Stat work unbelievably snug at times and I wish more would!

Hayter's run as World Champion really shook the foundation of the women's division, completely changing the in-ring style of the entire division for the better. Everybody had to step up to the insane quality of Hayter and most did. It really sucked that she went out with an injury because she was truly operating on another level – one that it seems like she's getting back to after returning.

All around, a fun Dynamite! Not a blow-me-away episode but easy to watch and lots of advancement for stories up and down the show. What more can you ask for in a weekly pro-wrestling show?
