With just a few weeks away from Double or Nothing and the finals of the [Owen Hart](/posts/2025-04-16-write-forever-aew-dynamite) tournament and one week away from Samoa Joe challenging Jon Moxley for the World Title in a steel cage, we've got some ground to cover before we know who is going to the main event of All In.

Tonight, there are no titles on the line but two Eliminators with Toni Storm in a four-way match against Thunder Rosa, Anna Jay, and Penelope Ford and Kazuchika Okada against [Kevin Knight](/posts/2025-04-02-write-forever-aew-dynamite). I could see Thunder Rosa sneaking out a pin on Penelope or something to get a match against Toni since, as we've been reminded many times, Rosa was never beat for the World Title.

Kevin Knight doesn't have much of a shot against Okada with Okada having Kenny Omega in his sights, but the match should be excellent if Okada gets out of first gear. Or if Okada dyes his hair red and [brings balloons to the ring](/posts/2018-07-20-njpw-g1-climax-28-day-four) – either way.

## What to do with Toni Storm?

In what I must stress is _not_ a complaint, I ask: what are we doing with Toni Storm? Storm obviously has the winner of the Owen Hart Cup at All In, but as of yet has nothing lined up for Double or Nothing. She's been powering through Eliminator matches and coming out on top each time, meaning she has no clear opponent lined up for the PPV in a few weeks.

I think it's too close to Double or Nothing to expect a new face to show up to challenge Toni or anything like that. So, is she going to burn herself out on Eliminator matches and slip up in the next week or two to be presented with a challenger at DoN?

Or, is she just going to keep on keeping on without a blemish to her record? And, what does it look like from May-July once Storm has a clear idea of who her challenger will be in Texas?

I'll be curious to see where we end up with Toni for Double or Nothing and I'm intrigued by the recent uptick in Eliminator matches. We've now seen Lady Frost, Thunder Rosa, Anna Jay, and Penelope Ford essentially put out of contention for Storm's title – so who's next? Kris Statlander? Willow Nightingale? A returning Mina Shirakawa?

For now, I'm enjoying the ride especially when Toni is given a chance to shout "I'M HERE AND I'M QUEER" into a microphone on live television.

## The power of the hometown pop

Tonight, in Detroit, Rhino made his AEW debut challenging Nick Wayne for the ROH TV Title in a losing effort. But that pop! The crowd was fired up for Rhino from entrance to exit and highlighted something that AEW does very well and bucks the trends of the 20-some-odd years of mainstream American pro-wrestling that predated All Elite Wrestling.

For ages, it was commonplace in WWE that if there was a show in your hometown you were getting, at the least, beaten and, at the most, embarrassed. It felt like the exceptions here were few and far between.

AEW does things differently in these situations, though. They often, and happily, don't humiliate people in their hometowns. In fact, they often even let people go over in their hometowns!

The reason this feels important is because it highlights a thing about wrestling that a lot of people don't understand: it's not complicated. Wrestling is _easy_, unless you needlessly complicate it feed whatever weird humiliation fetish you have.

There's nothing easier than putting people out there in front of their hometown people and letting them win a big match or, in the case of Rhino, have a flashy debut alongside an old friend. There were already rumblings that Rhino would be involved in the coming 2300 Arena residency and it was smart to get him on TV ahead of that in front of a crowd that would make sure he looked like a big deal.

## A fresh feel up and down the card

With just a few debuts and returns, much of the show feels fresher than it has in quite some time. Once Ricochet's heel turn hit, he felt like a much-needed little dipshit to oppose Swerve Strickland. With the Young Bucks back and teaming with Ricochet, things continue to feel a bit shaken up with a "what's old is new again" type of flavor. Plus, Ricochet gets to do a lot of hairplay with the Bucks's lustrous locks.

Elsewhere on the card, "Speedball" Mike Bailey debuted and was immediately over with the TV audience. I'd been critical of his work on the indies where I thought everything just felt a little too choreographed or _something_. There was just something about his offense that didn't click for me. In AEW, though, Bailey is an instant delight and feels unlike anyone else on the roster. 

Similarly, Kevin Knight may have lucked into the best first few months of anyone in AEW in a long time. He had a solid debut against Jay White but then ended up taking Jay's spot in the Owen Hart Cup when Jay went down with an injury. This gave Knight an immediate PPV match with Will Ospreay to catch the crowd's attention yet again. What would the plan have been had Jay White not been injured? As that lollipop commercial likes to tell us, the world may never know.

With Jamie Hayter back to her old ways of absolutely beating the shit out of people and being incredibly cocky along the way, the women's division feels like it's ready to kick off in a big way outside of the Toni Storm Extended Universe. Hayter and Mercedes Moné are set for Double or Nothing and with the quality of Mercedes' matches and her ability to bump like a maniac, I think we're gonna see some real sicko shit in Arizona.

Even simple moves like an FTR heel turn and the return of Stokely Hathaway to manage them gives new life to Dax and Cash while opening up the door for new feuds and matches in the tag division, not to mention a new layer being peeled back on Daniel Garcia who is demonstrating conflicting emotions due to his relationship with FTR.

I don't really know how it feels to the general AEW viewing audience, but this feels like the "hottest" and "freshest" AEW has felt in quite some time. The television hit a real lull earlier in the year but the past few months have been filled with shows whose baseline is "pretty good", and there have been few episodes of AEW television that have _just_ been "pretty good."

## Athena's Dropkick Power Rankings

This week, Samoa Joe and Claudio Castagnoli took turns whipping each other into the video barricade. The video barricade did not break into static. We can now update our Athena's Dropkick Power Rankings thusly:

1. Athena's Dropkick (victim: Mercedes Moné)
2. (Tied For Last) Brody King splashing people into the barricade; Hangman Adam Page throwing Kyle Fletcher into the barricade; Samoa Joe and Claudio Castagnoli whipping each other into the barricade

## Wrapping Up

Will Ospreay is now in full 90s _Home Improvement_ haircut mode and it's unsettling. It's... not a good look. Some of us just shouldn't straighten our hair. I did it for years! I flat-ironed ths shit out of my hair all through college! It wasn't until years later that I learned how to work _with_ my thick and wavy hair rather than working against it. Ospreay, get it together.

Hair aside (and Hangman has the better hair, not just because it's more like my own hair), Ospreay and Hanger had a good opening segment. Hangman is showing growth moving on from his blinding hatred of Swerve Strickland and Ospreay is ready to stake his claim as the number one guy in AEW. Those two are going to do ridiculous, stupid, amazing things at Double or Nothing.

The main event of Samoa Joe vs Claudio Castagnoli was fine but not a standout match for either guy. It had to go on last, I guess, to serve the purpose of a Death Riders swarm and a Powerhouse Hobbs save but it probably could have just as easily gone anywhere else on the show if there was any other match on the show that felt like a main event.

Collision is tomorrow night and it's looking good so far! Willow Nightingale vs Kris Statlander, Daniel Garcia vs one of the FTR Uncles, Mike Bailey vs Dralistico, and Anthony Bowens vs Lee Johnson. Not a bad start! And, of course, next week's Dynamite has the Joe/Mox steel cage match for the World Title – and with Joe and Hobbs taking Claudio out of the picture tonight, who's left to help Mox? Marina, Yuta... and Hook?
