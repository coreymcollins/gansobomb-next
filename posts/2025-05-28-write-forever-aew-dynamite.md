It's the post-[_Double or Nothing_](/posts/2025-05-25-write-forever-aew-double-or-nothing) episode of Dynamite and it's... sort of packed! I guess? As with most post-PPV episodes, not much is announced far in advance and we can probably expect a lot of storyline stuff up and down the show.

We know that we'll hear from "Hangman" Adam Page and see Mercedes Moné and Toni Storm go face-to-face, as well as [Brody King](/posts/2024-12-04-write-forever-aew-dynamite) wrestling Josh Alexander in the International Title Four-Way Tournament.

Plus, a late announcement that brings me much hope and also trepidation! Adam Cole defends the TBS Title against [Kyle Fletcher](/posts/2024-11-23-write-forever-aew-full-gear) and I hope upon hope that we pull the fucking trigger on Kyle Fletcher as a singles champion, shuttling Cole back to trios (or anywhere else, just not on commentary).

So let's see what we get! Will we end the night pleased by Kyle Fletcher or disappointed by Adam Cole?

## The lines are drawn around Hangman Page

In the show opener, ole Hanger cut a promo talking about his path to this point and his continuing path to the men's World Title at All In. Before he could say everything he wanted to say, though, a familiar face made his entrance: Swerve Strickland.

Swerve said he was out there for a specific reason and aired a clip of The Young Bucks talking about their previous work in costing Swerve the World Title as a favor to Page. Swerve asked if that was true and Hanger rebuked the claim, telling Swerve that for a split second he even thought about _helping_ Swerve against Moxley.

Will Ospreay was drawn out from the back and laid out a passionate plea to both men. He told them that the fans were starting to believe in them again and that it turned out Swerve wasn't the guy, and neither was Ospreay – instead, it was Hangman.

Ospreay said that they can work together to make things easier for Hangman against Jon Moxley and Death Riders prompting Swerve to slap the mic out of Ospreay's hands and go nose-to-nose. Swerve said he'd never work with Hangman and then stormed off.

Hangman said about the same to Ospreay before both men departed.

Is this building to Swerve/Ospreay at All In? I'm not sure either guy will have much else to do now that they're out of the men's World Title picture, and Swerve vs Ospreay is basically a guaranteed great match. We have 7 weeks until All In which means we have a _lot_ of time to see if Swerve or Hangman change their minds about working together.

I love a bit of intrigue in and around the main event. We know what Hangman is going to be doing at All In but we don't know what his situation will be with his enemies, friends, and in-betweens. Will Swerve begin to see some kind of light as a means to the end of Death Riders, or do some grudges run too deep?

## The women's division is stronger than ever

In a No DQ match, Megan Bayne and Penelope Ford defeated Harley Cameron and Anna Jay. Harley has been such an enjoyable watch the past several months. She gets better every time she's out and it's very cool to actually see someone learn, grow, and improve in real time.

Anna has also improved a lot since returning from STARDOM, and Penelope has looked great since returning from injury. Megan Bayne rules and always has!

It looked like Harley may have suffered a broken nose after being smashed onto the steps and Anna looked to pick up an undisclosed injury, maybe possibly also a broken nose or at least something rattling her noggin after taking Fate's Descent on a chair.

If ever there was an argument for women's Tag Team Titles, this was it.

Later in the show, Thekla debuted by attacking Jamie Hayter off-screen (in the middle of the ring) and in the dark, then hit her a second time and did an upside down spider pose before playing to the crowd. And, uh, that was it. Kind of sucked as a debut, not gonna lie! Thekla will be great because Thekla _is_ great but this debut didn't really sell her as a big deal in the least. Especially because they immediately cut to a video package about Mistico.

In the main event segment, Toni Storm and Mercedes Moné came face to face (and nose to neck) to spar back and forth about their upcoming match at All In. There was nothing revolutionary said or done here, but the segment _did_ underscore just how big this match is for AEW. These are, unquestionably, two of the best to ever do it in professional wrestling and it _feels_ like that without them having to do much at all.

This is my most looked-forward-to match of All In so far, largely because I know it's going to be great and I'll be happy with either outcome. By contrast, Hangman/Mox is something I'm sort of looking forward to but am hoping that they don't make the awful decision to keep the belt on Mox. Toni/Mercedes exist in a unique space where both are equally over and either one winning could lead to continued new and extraordinary things at the top of the women's division.

## The bullshitification of the TBS Title continues

I had a slight hope, a tiny dream. I saw the post on social media and I was momentarily titillated. Kyle Fletcher vs Adam Cole for the TBS Title? Could it be? A hotshot title change onto Fletcher to get us out of the doldrums of Adam Cole as champ?

I didn't think it was a lock but I wanted to believe.

A fool! What a fool I was! A fool to have hopes, to have tiny dreams, to _believe_ a good decision involving Adam Cole could actually be possible.

Kyle Fletcher looked great against Cole and, honestly, Cole looked good too. It was a fine match. And then the bullshit came with Josh Alexander interfering as Cole was about to hit Fletcher with The Boom running knee to finish things off.

Ah, yes. A DQ finish. A nonsense way to end a match to save everybody from something interesting actually happening.

I should have known. It felt too quick to take the title off of Adam Cole, though he has been rubbing the Callis Family the wrong way for few weeks now. I've also had my own hunch that Josh Alexander would be the guy to take the TBS Title off of Cole.

At this point, Fletcher feels too big for the TBS Title. He should be in contention for either of the other three men's titles, which are routinely presented as much bigger deals. Of course, he could always elevate the title out of the muck and mire of the Adam Cole reign.

Putting the title on someone like Alexander feels like a safer bet, though. He's a new commodity and while he's not quite as hot as Fletcher, he can still go like a madman in the ring and would absolutely wash some of the stink off of the belt.

So, does Alexander's interference lead to a one-on-one showdown between he and Cole? Maybe. But let's be careful about our slight hopes and tiny dreams.

## Wrapping Up

The Death Riders/Willow&Bailey&Briscoe mixed tag match was a lot of fun, but I am curious to see what is actually happening with Mike Bailey (and to a lesser extent, Mark Briscoe). Bailey came in hot and had an excellent Continental Title match with Okada at Double or Nothing. Being randomly slotted into this match feels like a not-so-great sign in regards to having a solid plan for him going forward.

Briscoe is less of a question for me as he seems to be nestled softly into the midcard without much upward mobility in his foreseeable future, which is a real shame. Briscoe would make a great TBS Champion and deserves a run with _some_ title in AEW as a reward for his consistently excellent work.

All around, this was a fun episode of Dynamite with one big thing (Thekla's debut), though it didn't really feel like a big thing. Not a lot of build to anything new or unusual, though we may have had some seeds planted that Kyle Fletcher is outgrowing the Don Callis Family Definitely looking forward to where that goes!
