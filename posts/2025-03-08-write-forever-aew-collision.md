It's a big AEW weekend with [Revolution](/posts/2024-03-03-write-forever-aew-revolution) coming in just under 24 hours and the card is absolutely stacked. There isn't a bad match on the card, though The Hurt Syndicate vs The Outrunners isn't going to be on anyone's match of the year list. I'm sure it'll still be a fun romp as we, I assume, continue on the path to an eventual Hurt Syndicate/Murder Machines match.

[Swerve/Ricochet](/posts/2025-02-05-write-forever-aew-dynamite) threatens to steal the show for me tomorrow night, but that's going to be a gargantuan task when we also have Ospreay/Fletcher in a cage, Takeshita/Omega, Mercedes/Momo, and Toni/Mariah.

Tonight, Daniel Garcia defends the TNT Title against [Lee Moriarty](/posts/2025-02-01-write-forever-aew-collision) at the top of the card while Serena Deeb faces Momo Watanabe and Hologram takes on Dralistico, plus more. Not a bad show to ease us into Sunday night!

## Nothing to write home about

This was one of those episodes of Collision that you could have missed and been completely fine never going back to watch. There was nothing on the show that was _bad_, but it was very clearly a holding pattern type of show with Revolution tomorrow night.

Hologram & Dralistico had a hell of a match with Hologram continuing his undefeated streak. We also took another step in the ongoing LFI/Hologram & Komander feud. When RUSH returns, will Holomander add a third to their ranks to even the odds? And, if so, will it be someone already on the roster or a new face/mask sauntering into AEW?

The last bits of storyline stuff leading into Revolution were all really good! Quick promos from everyone in the major matches, with some good stuff even coming out of Copeland and Moxley who I've not been fully into as a long-term story but have won me over a little bit in recent weeks.

Now that Death Riders have been shown to be fallible, they've become more interesting. It also hasn't hurt that Mox has done less rambling about his plans to make AEW better/stronger/faster and has had more focus in his subject matter when speaking. Talking about having similar paths as Copeland and keeping the Wheeler Yuta saga at the forefront was good stuff.

Daniel Garcia and Lee Moriarty had the match of the night, unsurprisingly. I really wish they'd do more with Shane Taylor and Lee more consistently on AEW TV. I know there's a bit more STP on Ring of Honor, but I don't have enough time in my week for all of that. Taylor and Moriarty are _so god damned good_ and deserve serious runs on AEW TV.

The Outrunners also had probably their best tag team match in AEW against the Premier Athletes which probably says more about the Premier Athletes than it does The Outrunners. I love The Outrunners but they're not having matches like FTR out there; their matches still feel a little clunky at times, but Tony Nese and Ariya Daivari helped pull the quality up quite a bit.

## Wrapping Up

There was almost nothing you needed to see in the first hour of this show. Serena Deeb vs Momo Watanabe was a fine match but nothing extraordinary. There were good promos building to Revolution from Will Ospreay, Kyle Fletcher, and Don Callis & Konosuke Takeshita but â€“ those were probably the best pieces from the first hour.

I'd be more down on this being an off-week for AEW TV considering they've been on fire the past several weeks, but I also don't expect a taped episode of Collision the night before a PPV to be pulling out all of the stops. Still, this felt like one of those episodes of Collision where it felt like Tony Khan forgot he had to book a show and quickly tweeted out matches starting at 4pm day-of.

~~Homer Simpson~~ Bobby Lashley, Smiling Politely, as The Hurt Syndicate made their way to the ring to watch the ending of The Outrunners match was one of the best things on this show.

Not much else to say! Thus ends AEW's streak of insane episode of TV, but Revolution should be an insane show tomorrow night so I'll give 'em a pass.
