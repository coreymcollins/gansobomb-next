It's been a couple of weeks due to late starts for both Dynamite and Collision and family/friend obligations, and I'm far too old to watch and write about an episode of wrestling starting at 10:30pm on a Wednesday night.

[Revolution](/posts/2024-03-03-write-forever-aew-revolution) is just over a week away and the card is shaping up to be a pretty good one, though I doubt we see any major changes around the top of the card. I don't think Cope will win the World Title from Mox – but if he does, I fully expect some shenanigans with Christian Cage to follow.

I'm not sure if I still think [Darby Allin](/posts/2024-12-18-write-forever-aew-dynamite) is going to be the one to wrest the World Title away Jon Moxley and Death Riders with his Mount Everest dreams looming, but I wouldn't mind that still being the outcome. The only thing is, I'm skeptical about everyone's ability to draw this Mox/Death Riders thing out any longer.

I've got high hopes that we'll at least see Claudio, PAC, and Yuta drop the Trios Titles sooner than later as a precursor to everything else falling apart for the group. As much as I've not enjoyed Adam Cole as a singles guy, I'd much rather see him and the Undisputed Kingdom become Trios Champions than see him challenge [Daniel Garcia](/posts/2024-11-30-write-forever-aew-collision) for the TNT Title.

## Bryan Keith is having a moment and I hope it lasts

[Bryan Keith](/posts/2024-02-03-write-forever-aew-collision) is incredible. He has been for years and years. I first became familiar with him while living in Texas and seeing his name pop up on shows around me all the time. Whether it was in person or on IWTV, I was always impressed with whatever he did.

In AEW, he had some real standout matches before he finally got the big _IS ALL ELITE_ graphic but of late, The Bounty Hunter hasn't had much of an opportunity to show out in the same way. That is, until the past couple of weeks.

Keith had an excellent match against Bandido a few weeks back on Collision where he got to remind everybody just how god damn good he actually is when he's not just backup and a few funny lines for Chris Jericho.

Tonight he had an equally enjoyable match with Will Ospreay with Ospreay picking up the win heading into his Revolution cage match against Kyle Fletcher.

In defeat, though, Keith showed once again why he was deserving of that _IS ALL ELITE_ graphic in the first place. In recent weeks, we've seen Big Bill and Bryan Keith step out from behind Jericho to establish their own feuds and have great matches respectively. I hope this is a trend that continues and that we get more and more of Keith tearing it up in the singles division, only with some wins along the way.

## Ricochet, Swerve, and Prince Nana are the main characters of AEW

I'm sure I wrote before that I wasn't thrilled with the idea of [Ricochet](/posts/2025-02-05-write-forever-aew-dynamite) coming to AEW. Not that he was a bad wrestler, just that the men's roster is already so overloaded that it felt unreasonable to add yet _another_ guy to the roster.

I was wrong.

Initially, though, I was right! Ricochet's first few weeks in the company did nothing for me as he played the shiny, happy babyface. But then the cracks started to form.

Swerve drove Ricochet to the edge and then pushed him over with a toilet paper shower at Worlds End. Since then, Ricochet has been on another level as a crazed, scissor-swinging, serial killer glasses wearing maniac.

Seeing Ricochet do what he did in Lucha Underground and then WWE, I wasn't prepared for just how good he could be as a sadistic and antagonistic heel.

Tonight, Prince Nana laid it all out on the line in a challenge from Swerve Strickland to Ricochet: take the match you don't want to have and the winner becomes the number one contender for the World Title. Ricochet barely had to think about the offer before snapping it up, but then Nana had to lay out one more deal for Swerve.

Nana stepped up to Swerve and pleaded with him to retrieve the robe of Jimmy Rave which is currently draping over the shoulders of that son of a bitch thief Ricochet. Nana, truthfully and reasonably, told Swerve that he had suffered many times at the hands of Swerve's rivals in service of Swerve and that now it was time for Swerve to do this one thing for Nana.

If the robe could not be returned, Nana lamented, then he could no longer stand by Swerve's side.

I hope this isn't leading to a Nana turn to align himself with Ricochet and that it's just Nana being deadly honest with Swerve. They're such a perfect, classic pairing that it's hard to imagine them not being together.

## The Rated G Superstar Willow Nightingale

It seemed like they forgot about the whole Marina Shafir/[Willow Nightingale](/posts/2024-02-14-write-forever-aew-dynamite) thing for _months_ after they first interacted with one another. Luckily, they came back around to it a few weeks back and now Marina has a counterpart who she could actually wrestle at some point.

Tonight, Cope continued the dismantling of Death Riders by laying out Claudio Castagnoli with a Conchairto after doing the same to PAC on Collision. During the fray, Marina caught an errant Busaiku Knee from Wheeler Yuta rendering her unconscious – and in position for a Conchairto from Copeland.

Not to be outdone or ignored, as Copeland raised the chair over his head Willow Nightingale's music hit and she stomped toward the ring. Willow took the chair and finished the job, squashing Marina's head like a grape between two steel chairs.

I guess now that Marina has been murdered, though, she won't be wrestling Willow any time soon. And, with Cope taking out the Trios Champions one by one, what does this mean for the Trios Titles? Will they continue to sit around the waists of a team who are being murdered more and more frequently? Will they be stripped so we can get new champs who actually do something with the belts? Will we see the belts completely abandoned and memory holed since it doesn't seem like they can keep up with booking all of the belts they have?

Only time will tell!

## Wrapping Up

On Collision we got a fun shot of the commentators standing on the stage with the crowd behind them and on Dynamite tonight we got the commentators standing at ringside with the crowd behind them to run down the card. I love it! I love unique or just old-school types of shots like this. Give me a tiny stage for interviews like 1990s WWF, please. I love that shit.

In the build to Hangman Page vs MJF, MJF (fresh off of the cleanest tattoo removal in human history) left Christopher Daniels bloodied backstage to further rile up ole Hanger. Tonight we learned that Hangman obviously has power of attorney over Daniels, as the medical staff legally couldn't help the Fallen Angel until Hangman gave verbal consent.

I don't love the "theme song to distraction roll-up finish" pipeline but I also love The Outrunners so I'm a little torn. The main positive is that it's clear that this isn't the end of things for The Hurt Syndicate and Murder Machines. The Hurt Syndicate will tear The Outrunners apart quickly and still have Cage and Archer down the road.

Harley Cameron is getting better every week. She's not on the level of the mainstays of the division yet but you can actually see her improve from match to match which has been a lot of fun to see. Not to mention, her new gear is super fun and something Hologram could take a lesson from – shiny gear, pal! You're a Hologram man! Be shinier!

When it comes to the main event of Konosuke Takeshita vs Orange Cassidy for the International Title, I don't have much to say other than it was an incredible main event. I love when I go into a match absolutely "knowing for sure" what the outcome is going to be but still end up biting on every nearfall in the final moments of the match.

Cassidy is just sensational every time he steps into an AEW ring and Takeshita is one of the most exciting wrestlers on the roster. Putting the two of them together was an easy recipe for success that over-delivered. I assume we'll see Takeshita drop the International Title to Kenny Omega at Revolution, but if he does I hope it's only to push him further up the card because that's exactly where he (and OC) deserve to be.
